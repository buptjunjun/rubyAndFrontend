1
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,071
杜弗伦先生  请你描述...
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:12,024
命案当晚和妻子争吵的情形
the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:18,058
我们吵的很凶
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:23,025
她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸
She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,028
她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:32,019
-你怎样回答?  -我拒绝离婚
-What was your response?  -I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,056
"你别想活着去雷诺市"
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:39,010
邻居作证你说过这句话
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,080
也许吧
If they say so.

10
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,083
我气炸了  记不清楚
I really don't remember. I was upset.

11
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,054
你们吵完以后呢?
What happened after you argued with your wife?

12
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,048
她收拾行李
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:54,081
去跟昆丁先生住一起
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:59,055
葛兰昆丁  乡村俱乐部的高球教练
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:02,089
你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫
whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,056
你跟踪她吗?
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,083
我先去酒吧买醉
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:14,040
然后去他家  但没人在
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:17,003
我停了车
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,026
等他们
and waited.

21
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,007
用意何在?
With what intention?

22
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,011
我不确定
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,074
我醉了
I was confused...

24
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:26,003
糊里糊涂
drunk.

25
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,009
我想...
I think...

26
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,014
最多只是吓吓他们
mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:34,072
结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,008
不  我逐渐酒醒
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:40,089
开车回家睡觉
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,007
路中把枪丢入皇家河
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

31
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,026
我已讲的很清楚
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:50,057
但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,037
发现床上的双尸
and finds your wife in bed with her lover...

34
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,067
身上满是点三八的弹孔
riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:57,005 --> 00:04:01,025
你不觉得这很巧吗?  还是只有我这么想?
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,014
是很巧
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,052
但你仍声称早在案发之前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,084
就已丢弃了枪
before the murders took place.

39
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,022
这种说法倒是很省事
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,009
这是实话
It's the truth.

41
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:18,003
警方打捞三天都没找到
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,069
这样就无法比对
so no comparison could be made

43
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,061
你的手枪和
between your gun and the bullets...

44
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,003
受害者尸体上的弹痕
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

45
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,005
所以呢
And that also...

46
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,095
这样也非常省事  不是吗  杜弗伦先生?
is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

47
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,035
我是清白的
Since I am innocent of this crime...

48
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:41,019
所以找不到枪反倒对我非常不利
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

49
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,044
一切证据都向各位报告了
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

50
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:06,048
脚印和胎痕证明被告在场
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

51
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,055
散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

52
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,072
酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

53
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,048
最重要的是...
And most of all...

54
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,075
一位美女与情夫...
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

55
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,099
相拥而死
lying dead in each other's arms.

56
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:23,079
他们是有伤风化
They had sinned.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,053
但是...
But was their crime so great...

58
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,000
罪该致死吗?
as to merit a death sentence?

59
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,051
请各位与此同时...
While you think about that...

60
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:35,074
再考虑一件事
think about this:

61
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:39,050
一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,025
所以他并非一时冲动
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.
改编自斯蒂芬·金的短篇小说《丽塔海华丝及萧山克监狱的救赎》

63
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:47,025
冲动并不可宽恕  但可理解
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

64
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,048
然而...
No.

65
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,085
这是复仇
This was revenge...

66
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:54,047
残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看
of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

67
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,007
这两人各中四枪
Four bullets per victim.

68
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,053
共八枪  而非六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.

69
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:03,063
因此他是先射完一轮
That means that he fired the gun empty...

70
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:05,081
再装弹补上两枪
and then stopped to reload...

71
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:12,021
然后再一人添一枪
so that he could shoot each of them again. An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,081
射穿脑袋
right in the head.

73
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:23,012
你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,066
看见你就令我齿冷
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,033
根据缅因州赋予我的权力...
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:34,083
我判处你两次终身监禁 按序执行
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,073
每名受害者一次  退庭!
one for each of your victims. So be it!

78
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,003
坐下
Sit.

79
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:11,041
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满20年
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:15,054
-是的  -你改过自新了吗?
-Yes, sir.  -You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:18,054
是的  改造好了
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,068
我已得到深刻教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,019
真的  我已洗心革面
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,079
我不会再做危害社会的事了
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,097
我向上帝发誓
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,000
驳回

87
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,057
瑞德
Hey, Red.

88
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:13,007
怎样?
How'd it go?

89
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,043
还不是老样子
Same old shit, different day.

90
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:17,057
我了解
Yeah, I know how you feel.

91
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:19,077
我下周也准备要吃闭门羹
I'm up for rejection next week.

92
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:23,007
我上周才假释被拒
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

93
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,058
很正常
It happens.

94
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:26,022
嗨，瑞德，借一包烟吧
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

95
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:29,072
滚开  你欠我五包
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

96
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,091
-四包  -五包
-Four!  -Five!

97
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,049
美国每个监狱里可能都会有我这样的人
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

98
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,049
我能为你弄到各种东西
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

99
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,079
香烟啦  大麻啦
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,044
家有喜事想喝白兰地也行
bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

101
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,076
几乎是任何合理的东西
Damn near anything within reason.

102
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:50,070
是的 先生  我就像百货公司
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

103
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,058
所以1949年  安迪·杜弗伦...
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...

104
00:08:56,078 --> 00:09:00,034
让我替他弄张丽塔·海华丝的电影海报
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

105
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,082
我立刻回答 没问题!
I told him, "No problem."

106
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:26,087
大家到大门口集合
to the main gate

107
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:30,038
到大门口集合
to the main gate

108
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,086
安迪在47年初入肖申克监狱
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

109
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,097
因为杀害老婆和情夫
in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

110
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,036
他本来是缅因州一家大银行的副总裁
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

111
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,060
年轻有为 前程远大
Good work for a man so young.

112
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,047
瑞德
Here Red

113
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,062
听得懂英语吗?
You speak English, butt-steak?

114
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,069
跟这位长官走
You follow this officer.

115
00:10:57,044 --> 00:11:01,070
我这辈子没看过这么多满脸晦气的窝囊废
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

116
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,053
菜鸟  过来
Hey, fish! Come over here!

117
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,020
打个赌吧, 瑞德?
Taking bets today, Red?

118
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,026
赌烟或钱?
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

119
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,016
烟  我赌两根
Smokes. Put me down for two.

120
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:35,026
你挑哪个?
All right, who's your horse?

121
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:37,024
那个小个子
That little sack of shit.

122
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:42,011
-前头数来第八个他是第一个  -算你瞎眼 我赌了
-Eighth. He'll be first.  -Bullshit! I'll take that action.

123
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,051
你输定了
You're out some smokes, son.

124
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:46,048
你聪明  你挑呀
If you're so smart, you call it.

125
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,078
胖脸肥臀那个
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

126
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,058
第五个  我赌五根烟
The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.

127
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,049
菜鸟来了
Fresh fish today!

128
00:11:58,026 --> 00:11:59,075
菜鸟来啦
We're reeling them in!

129
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,006
说实话  当初我并不看好他
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

130
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,050
弱不禁风的
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

131
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,097
这是他给我的最初印象
That was my first impression of the man.

132
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:11,061
你挑谁?
What do you say?

133
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:15,011
面带富贵相的高个儿
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

134
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,044
他?不可能啦
That guy? Never happen.

135
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:19,091
-我赌十根烟  -有种
-10 cigarettes.  -That's a rich bet.

136
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,018
谁要和我赌?
Who's going to prove me wrong?

137
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,018
赫伍?  渣哥?
Heywood? Jigger?

138
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,079
史基?
Skeets?

139
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:27,032
福洛?
Floyd!

140
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:30,032
你们输定了
Four brave souls.

141
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:33,029
回牢房准备点名
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

142
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,080
全部回房去
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

143
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,031
向右转
Turn to the right!

144
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,082
看前方
Eyes front.

145
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,050
他是警备队长海利
This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.

146
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,080
我是典狱长诺顿
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

147
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,020
你们被判有罪
You are convicted felons.

148
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:22,050
所以被送到这来
That's why they've sent you to me.

149
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:24,048
第一条规定:
Rule number one:

150
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,017
不许亵渎上帝
No blasphemy.

151
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:30,012
这不许有任何亵渎上帝的行为
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

152
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,052
其它规矩...
The other rules...

153
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:35,002
你们以后就知道了  有问题吗?
you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?

154
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,045
什么时候吃饭?
When do we eat?

155
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:47,016
我们叫你吃就吃
You eat when we say you eat.

156
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:50,064
叫你拉就拉  叫你撒就撒
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.

157
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:53,068
听明白了吗？你这蠢货
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

158
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,091
站起来
On your feet.

159
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,088
我只相信两件事
I believe in two things:

160
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,057
纪律和圣经
Discipline and the Bible.

161
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,011
你们两样都少不了
Here, you'll receive both.

162
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,005
把信仰寄托神
Put your trust in the Lord.

163
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,089
把贱命交给我
Your ass belongs to me.

164
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:13,063
肖申克监狱欢迎各位
Welcome to Shawshank.

165
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,017
解铐
Unhook them.

166
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,098
转身
Turn around.

167
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,025
可以了
That's enough.

168
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,015
走到底
Move to the end of the cage.

169
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,068
转身  洒除虱粉
Turn around. Delouse him.

170
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,009
转身
Turn around.

171
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:50,063
到左边领囚衣和圣经
Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.

172
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,017
下一个
Next man up!

173
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:55,091
向右
To the right.

174
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,017
右转  右转
Right. Right.

175
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,097
向左
Left.

176
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:03,018
头一夜最难熬  绝对如此
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.

177
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:06,074
光着屁股行进
They march you in naked as the day you were born...

178
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:10,075
火辣的药粉令你半盲
skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.

179
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,082
当你进笼...
And when they put you in that cell...

180
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,036
门闸锁上...
and those bars slam home...

181
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,002
你才明白这是玩真的
that's when you know it's for real.

182
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:22,063
眨眼间  一生就毁了
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

183
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:27,023
只留下无穷的悔恨
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

184
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:31,071
新囚在初夜多半濒临疯狂
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

185
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:34,098
总会有人哭出来
Somebody always breaks down crying.

186
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:37,014
毫无例外
Happens every time.

187
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,085
我们只是...
The only question is...

188
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,081
等着看是谁
who's it going to be?

189
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,016
用这聚赌也挺有趣的
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

190
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:49,089
我赌安迪·杜弗伦
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

191
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,056
熄灯
Lights out!

192
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:23,042
我还记得我在这的第一夜
I remember my first night.

193
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,020
虽然那已经是很久很久以前的事了
Seems like a long time ago.

194
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,003
菜鸟  来嘛
Hey, fish.

195
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:34,087
菜鸟  菜鸟
Fish, fish.

196
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:38,020
怎么  怕黑吗?
What are you, scared of the dark?

197
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,024
后悔爸妈搞出你来?
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!

198
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,088
小猪猪  你的肉好香
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

199
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:58,046
老鸟总是捉弄菜鸟
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.

200
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,073
直到惹哭才罢休
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.

201
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,073
猪公
Hey, Fat Ass.

202
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:07,057
肥臀
Fat Ass!

203
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:10,047
说句话嘛
Talk to me, boy.

204
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,088
我听得到你呼吸
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

205
00:17:14,008 --> 00:17:17,005
你别受这些白痴的骗
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?

206
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,015
这儿没那么糟啦
This place ain't so bad.

207
00:17:19,058 --> 00:17:20,081
跟你讲...
Tell you what...

208
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,018
我帮你引见  带你进入状况
I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.

209
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:28,075
有些同志...
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just...

210
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,093
想亲近你
Iove to make your acquaintance.

211
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:34,062
还有你那白肉肥臀
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.

212
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,092
天哪
God!

213
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,000
我不要坐牢
I don't belong here!

214
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,004
-有人中奖了  -我要回家
-We have a winner!  -I want to go home!

215
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,097
肥臀先驰得分
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

216
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:50,048
菜鸟  菜鸟
Fresh fish!

217
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:52,084
我不属于这里
I don't belong here

218
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:56,045
我要回家
I want to go home!

219

我要见我妈妈
I want my mother!

220
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:01,002
我搞过你妈  不够爽
I had your mother! She wasn't that great!

221
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:07,045
天杀的  你们在搞什么鬼?
What the Christ is this horseshit?

222
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,076
他亵渎上帝 我要报告监狱长
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

223
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:12,040
呆着不舒服想吃棍子吗?
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

224
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:13,046
放我出去呀
Let me out!

225
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,001
你发什么神经病，你这混蛋肥猪
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

226
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:20,020
求求你  别关我
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

227
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,077
别关我
Not me!

228
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,031
我不想数到三  连一我都不数
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

229
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,068
马上给我闭嘴  不然就给你来段催眠曲
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

230
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,078
-闭嘴啦  -求求你  你们弄错了
Shut up, man. Shut up!

231
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:33,018
你们不明白  我不该坐牢的
You don't understand.  I'm not supposed to be here.

232

开门
Open that cell.

233
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:38,016
我也不想蹲你这破牢
Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,066
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

235
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:54,091
长官  别激动
Captain, take it easy!

236
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,057
今天晚上如果再有人敢哀哀叫...
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...

237
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:24,021
我就扁得你们全部躺进医务室
I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

238
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:27,004
我说的是每一个人
Every last motherfucker in here.

239
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:34,011
把这废人抬去医务室
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

240
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:53,010
安迪头一夜就害我输两包烟
His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

241
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,030
他一声都没吭
He never made a sound.

242
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,099

你要吃吗?
Are you going to eat that?

250
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,013
无此打算
I hadn't planned on it.

251
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,043
给我好吗?
Do you mind?

252
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,067
又肥又嫩
That's nice and ripe.

253
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,022
杰克 说谢谢你
Jake says thank you.

254
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:59,089
他从巢中掉到地上
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

255
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:04,070
我要养到他会飞
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

256
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,083
讨厌  赫伍来了
Oh, no! Here he comes.

257
00:22:10,098 --> 00:22:12,041
早安  伙计们
Morning, fellas.

258

真是个美好早晨啊
Fine morning, isn't it?

259
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:17,014
你知道为何如此美好吗?
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

260
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,065
烟拿出来  就地排好
Send them down. I want them lined up...

261
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:22,048
像合唱队一样排整齐
just like a pretty little chorus line.

262
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:24,078
看呀  真壮观
Look at that.

263
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:28,049
-真受不了他  -我的乖乖
-I can't stand this guy.  -Oh, Lord!

264
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,065
爽  正牌 烤烟
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

265
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,019
闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!

266
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,039
闻完再闻我的
After he smells mine.

267
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,053
瑞德  可惜你大大看走眼
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

268
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:42,057
不过我真感谢我的猪公
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

269
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,077
出院后我得亲亲他
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

270
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:50,018
请他抽烟才对  小人得志
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

271
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,001
嘿,泰瑞
Hey, Tyrell.

272
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,034
这周你在医务室值班吗?
You pull infirmary duty this week?

273
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,088
那肥仔怎样了?
How's my horse doing anyway?

274
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,041
挂了
Dead.

275
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:01,045
海利打烂他的头
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

276
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,085
医生已回家睡觉了
Doc had gone home for the night.

277
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,063
他一直僵到天亮
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

278
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,032
根本无药可救
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

279
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,090
他叫什么名字?
What was his name?

280
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:21,054
你说什么?
What'd you say?

281
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:25,085
我想知道他的名字
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

282
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:29,028
关你屁事  菜鸟
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

283
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,042
死人还要什么名字
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.

284
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
嘿
Hey

285
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:57,047
有人上过你了吗?
Anybody come at you yet?

286
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,045
你名草有主了吗?
Anybody get to you yet?

287
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:05,065
牢里人人需要朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.

288
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:07,062
我可以当你朋友
I could be a friend to you.

289
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,023
不易上手
Hard to get.

290
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:21,083
我喜欢
I like that.

291
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:32,001
起初安迪不与人来往
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

292
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,032
大概心事重重
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

293
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:37,059
努力适应牢狱生活
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

294
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:41,052
直到一个月后...
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...

295
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:44,009
他主动才找人攀谈
to say more than two words to somebody.

296
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,085
那个人...
As it turned out...

297
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,020
就是我
that somebody was me.

298
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:59,074
我叫安迪·杜弗伦
I'm Andy Dufresne.

299
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,071
杀妻的银行家
Wife-killing banker.

300
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:06,028
为了什么?
Why'd you do it?

301
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,078
我没犯罪
I didn't, since you ask.

302
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,022
你来对地方了
You're going to fit right in.

303
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:14,012
这里人人都无罪
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

304
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:17,095
-赫伍  你为何入狱?  -我无罪  被律师害了
-What you in here for?  -Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

305
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,056
听说你颇爱耍酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

306
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:27,036
难道你的屁比别人香?
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

307
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,006
你说呢?
What do you think?

308
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,047
说老实话  我还不清楚
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

309
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:36,041
我知道你很有办法
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

310
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,068
我能够让你有求必应
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

311
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:42,068
我想要一把石捶
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

312
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,091
什么?
What?

313
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:45,045
石捶
A rock hammer.

314
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:48,049
-用来干什么?  -何必问呢?
-What is it and why?  -What do you care?

315
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:52,056
若是牙刷  我就直接报价
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.

316
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:55,020
因为牙刷不危险  对吗?
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

317
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,017
也有道理
Fair enough.

318
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,023
石捶大约六  七寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

319
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:03,077
-像鹤嘴锄  -鹤嘴锄?
-Looks like a miniature pickax.  -Pickax?

320
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,017
敲石头用的
For rocks.

321
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:09,001
石英?
Quartz?

322
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:16,055
云母  页岩...
And some mica, shale...

323
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:18,092
石灰石
limestone.

324
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,028
所以呢?
So?

325
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,006
我曾是石痴
So I'm a rock hound.

326
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,059
我想重拾往日嗜好
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.

327
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,099
我看你是想捶人家脑袋
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

328
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,003
不是的  这儿没有人犯着我
No, I have no enemies here.

329
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,060
没有? 且慢
No? Wait a while.

330
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:38,077
话已传开了
Word gets around.

331
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,093
三姐妹对你有性趣
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

332
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:45,011
尤其是包格斯
Especially Bogs.

333
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:49,055
我会告诉他们我不是同性恋 我帮不了他们
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

334
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,019
他们也不是
Neither are they.

335
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,085
同性恋也是人  但他们是禽兽
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

336
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:03,077
想干就干  根本不在乎你
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.

337
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:07,049
我若是你  便会加倍提防
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

338
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:10,047
-谢谢你的忠告  -反正不用钱
-Thanks for the advice.  -Well, that's free.

339
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,078
你明白我的顾虑吧
You understand my concern.

340
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:15,057
我不用石捶惹事  行吗?
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

341
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:20,054
那你想逃狱  挖地道?
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

342
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,011
有什么好笑?
What did I miss?  What's so funny?

343
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:26,022
你看到它就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

344
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:30,029
它市价多少?
What's an item like this usually go for?

345
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,099
奇石店卖七元
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

346
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,099
我通常加两成
My normal markup's 20 percent.

347
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,053
不过嘛
But this is a specialty item.

348
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:43,020
价钱随风险调高  跟你收十元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

349
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,074
就这样
Ten it is.

350
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,050
其实你是白花钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.

351
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:50,008
为什么?
Why's that?

352
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:54,051
狱方喜欢突袭搜房
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

353
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:58,009
找到石捶一定没收
They find it, you're going to lose it.

354
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:00,038
到时候别摆我道
If they catch you, you don't know me.

355
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,082
否则再也别想跟我做生意
Mention my name, we never do business again.

356
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:06,042
连口香糖都不卖你
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?

357
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,082
我懂
I understand.

358
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,013
谢谢你,你叫..
Thank you, Mr...

359
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:13,036
瑞德
Red.

360
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,089
叫我瑞德
Name's Red.

361
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,030
瑞德
Red

362
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:18,047
为何叫瑞德?
Why do they call you that?

363
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:24,024
也许我是爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

364
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:35,029
怪不得有人认为他臭屁
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

365
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,059
他闷声不响的
He had a quiet way about him...

366
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:43,009
他的步伐和谈吐简直是异类
a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

367
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,092
他像...
He strolled...

368
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,030
在公园散步  无忧无虑
like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

369
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:54,017
仿佛身披隐形衣
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

370
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,077
没错
yes

371
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,034
我打一开始...
I think it'd be fair to say...

372
00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:00,085
就喜欢他
I liked Andy from the start.

373
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:06,018
别耽误我们时间
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.

374
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:12,002
快点 快点
Move it! Come on, move it!

375
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:17,066
最近好吗? 你老婆对你怎么样?
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?

376
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,018
继续走
keep moving

377
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:33,048
继续走
just go

378
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,025
瑞德
Red

379
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,020
安迪说的对
Andy was right.

380
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,064
见到货就明白
I finally got the joke.

381
00:29:59,094 --> 00:30:02,034
用它挖地道...
It would take a man about 600 years...

382
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:05,004
得挖六百年
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

383
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,022
-要书吗?  -不要
-Book?  -Not today.

384
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,025
-要书吗?  -不要
-Book? -Not

385
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,069
老布
Brook

386
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,076
给杜弗伦的货
Delivery for Dufresne.

387
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:35,094
要书吗?
Book?

388
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,007
要书吗?
Book?

389
00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:45,005
杜弗伦
Dufresne

390
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,011
你的书
Here's your book.

391
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:53,029
谢谢
Thanks.

392
00:30:58,054 --> 00:31:03,032
杜弗伦  漂白粉不够了  你去后面拿点
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

393
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:42,014
这东西会弄瞎你的眼睛
This will blind you.

394
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:44,091
宝贝  别这样
Honey, hush.

395
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:59,043
你反抗
That's it. You fight!

396
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:01,012
那更刺激
Better that way.

397
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:12,043
我也希望另一种结局...
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...

398
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,063
就是安迪打赢  全身而退
and the Sisters let him be.

399
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:17,004
我希望如此
I wish I could tell you that...

400
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:20,022
然而监狱不是童话世界
but prison is no fairy-tale world.

401
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,032
他从没说过是谁干的
He never said who did it.

402
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:25,015
但谁都明白
But we all knew.

403
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:32,048
日子就这样一天天过去
Things went on like that for a while.

404
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,039
监狱生活就像例行公事
Prison life consists of routine...

405
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:37,063
除此之外还是例行公事
and then more routine.

406
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:43,066
安迪脸上身上时时带着伤
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

407
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:46,097
三姐妹不放过他
The Sisters kept at him.

408
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:49,027
他有时打赢
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

409
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,097
有时吃败仗
Sometimes not.

410
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,031
这就是安迪的监狱生活
And that's how it went for Andy.

411
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,065
这就是他的例行公事
That was his routine.

412
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:00,092
我相信最初那两年是他最糟糕的两年
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

413
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:04,079
我也相信如果日子继续这样过下去的话
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...

414
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,056
这个地方早晚会把他给毁了
this place would have got the best of him.

415
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:11,013
不过  在1949年的春天...
But then, in the spring of 1949...

416
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,023
监狱管理层决定
the powers that be decided:

417
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:16,077
车牌厂的屋顶需要修整
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

418
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:20,017
我需要12名志愿者工作一周
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

419
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,037
你们都知道...
As you know...

420
00:33:23,008 --> 00:33:26,064
特别的公差享特别的待遇
special detail carries with it special privileges.

421
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:29,025
这是户外公差
It was outdoor detail...

422
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:33,092
而五月是户外活动的好月份  实在求之不得
and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

423
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:35,049
排好队
Stay in line there.

424
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:38,086
一百多人志愿报名
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

425
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:46,013
昂格
Wallace E. Unger.

426
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:49,000
瑞丁
Ellis Redding.

427
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:50,076
这不是很巧吗?
Wouldn't you know it?

428
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:54,051
我的哥儿们全都中签
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

429
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,070
安迪·杜弗伦
Andrew Dufresne.

430
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:00,005
其实是每人一包烟买的
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

431
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:03,004
我照常抽两成
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

432
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:06,068
德州一个律师打电话来
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

433
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,045
我问什么事?
I say, "Yeah?"

434
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:12,035
他说"抱歉  令兄过世"
He says, "Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

435
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:16,046
-糟糕  我很遗憾  -我才不为那烂人遗憾
-I'm sorry to hear that.  -I'm not. He was an asshole.

436
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,086
他离家多年  生死不明
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.

437
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,037
这大律师说...
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

438
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:25,080
"令兄是位富翁" 挖油井赚了一百万
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

439
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:28,024
一百万?
A million bucks?

440
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:33,004
-对  算他走狗运  -有你一份吗?
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.  -You going to see any of that?

441
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:36,041
他留给我三万五
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.

442
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:38,038
-美金?  -对
Dollars?

443
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:41,055
简直像中乐透嘛
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.

444
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,098
不是吗?
Isn't it?

445
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:46,016
政府是白混的吗?
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?

446
00:34:46,036 --> 00:34:48,073
它想大口分掉这大饼
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

447
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,083
可怜虫  过路财神
Poor Byron.

448
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:54,090
真够倒霉
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

449
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,037
有人就是命衰
Some people really got it awful.

450
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:59,001
你疯了?
Andy, are you nuts?

451
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,011
专心干活
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

452
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:04,028
缴了税还剩不少
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

453
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:07,028
没错  够换新车
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?

454
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:09,065
但买车要缴税
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

455
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,062
还要修理  保养  孩子吵着要兜风
maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

456
00:35:13,086 --> 00:35:17,052
万一报错税  全得自付
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

457
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,085
告诉你  这就是政府
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

458
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,009
石头都榨得出血来
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

459
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,037
安迪  安迪
Andy

460
00:35:26,074 --> 00:35:28,090
-他不想活了  -继续工作
-Getting himself killed. -I Keep tarring.

461
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:31,066
什么哥哥  狗屁
Some brother. Shit!

462
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,001
海利先生
Mr. Hadley...

463
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:40,025
你信任老婆吗?
do you trust your wife?

464
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:43,038
真好笑
Oh, that's funny.

465
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,048
你没了牙吹我喇叭更好笑
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

466
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:50,006
她会扯你后腿吗?
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?

467
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,056
够了  他活的不耐烦了
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.

468
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,082
他要推落安迪
He'll push him off!

469
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:57,090
她靠得住...
If you trust her, you can keep...

470
00:35:58,013 --> 00:35:59,053
你就能领三万五
that 35,000.

471
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:03,043
-你说什么?  -三万五
-What did you say?  -Thirty-five thousand.

472
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,063
全部领到
All of it.

473
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:07,090
-一个子儿也不少  -你最好别耍我
-Every penny.  -You better start making sense.

474
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:10,044
想领全额  就赠与太太
If you want to keep it,  give it to your wife.

475
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:14,055
国税局允许一生一次  最多六万的赠与免税
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

476
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:17,012
-乖乖  免税吗?  -对
-Bullshit. Tax-free?  -Tax-free.

477
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:19,029
国税局征不到一文钱
IRS can't touch one cent.

478
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:22,018
你是那杀妻的银行家?
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.

479
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,076
信任你难道不会害我坐牢?
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?

480
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:28,080
完全合法  你去问也一样
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.

481
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,006
我不该开口的  我以为你会去问
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.

482
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:36,093
我不用你教我这些鸟事
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

483
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:40,054
没错  但你要找人填表
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.

484
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:42,030
请律师可得花钱
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

485
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:44,078
没卵的讼棍
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

486
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,071
我帮你办  为你省钱
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

487
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:50,098
你领表我来填
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

488
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,095
完全免费
nearly free of charge.

489
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,049
只要请我同事一人三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

490
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,099
同事?  够新鲜的
"Coworkers." That's rich!

491
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,036
做黑手的有酒喝
A man working outdoors feels more like a man...

492
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:07,002
才有尊严  这是我的浅见
if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...

493
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,046
大人
sir.

494
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,034
看什么看  回去干活
What are you jimmies staring at?

495
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:16,014
干活
Let's go! Work!

496
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,059
于是呢...
And that's how it came to pass...

497
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,045
在完工前一天...
that on the second-to-last day of the job...

498
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:35,022
49年春的公差犯人...
the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49...

499
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:38,056
在早上十点坐成一堆
wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning...

500
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:44,023
喝着冰镇啤酒  肖申克监狱...
drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...

501
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:47,071
历来最狠的狱官请的客
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

502
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:50,035
娘儿们  趁凉快喝
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

503
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:56,001
这王八蛋还装大方呢
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

504
00:37:57,015 --> 00:38:01,061
阳光洒肩头  仿佛自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

505
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:05,043
像在修缮自家屋顶
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

506
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:08,046
我们像是造物之主般自在
We were the lords of all creation.

507
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,062
安迪呢...
As for Andy...

508
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:13,050
他窝在凉荫下
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

509
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,019
脸上挂着奇异微笑
a strange little smile on his face...

510
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,063
看着我们喝他的酒
watching us drink his beer.

511
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:28,011
来一瓶吧?
Want a cold one?

512
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,072
谢谢  我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

513
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:38,075
你可说  他想拍狱方马屁
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.

514
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:43,026
或想博取囚犯友谊
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

515
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,006
但我呢?
Me?

516
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:48,007
认为他只想重温自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again...

517
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,074
即使只有一刹那
if only for a short while.

518
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,047
我当王
IKing me.

519
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:58,097
-下棋  是帝王游戏  -什么?
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings. -What?

520
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,091
讲文明  重谋略
Civilized. Strategic.

521
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:04,058
神秘的要死  真讨厌
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

522
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,062
改天我教你吧
Let me teach you someday.

523
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:09,015
好呀
Sure.

524
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,036
我想买个棋盘
We could get a board together.

525
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,065
你找对人了  我不论什么都弄得到
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?

526
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:18,086
棋盘用买的  但棋子我来刻
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

527
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:22,037
一半用雪花石膏  一半用皂石
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?

528
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:24,037
要刻上许多年
I think it'll take years.

529
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:27,010
时间有的是  就是缺石头
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

530
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,028
操场很贫瘠
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

531
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:31,031
多半是石子
Pebbles, mostly.

532
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:38,045
咱们算是朋友吧?
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

533
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:40,088
算是吧
Yeah, I guess.

534
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:43,005
我想问你
Can I ask you something?

535
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:45,096
你为何杀人?
Why'd you do it?

536
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,076
我无罪
I'm innocent, Red.

537
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,099
跟大家一样
Just like everybody else here.

538
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:56,090
你呢?
What are you in for?

539
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:01,077
跟你一样  杀人
Murder. Same as you.

540
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,014
无罪吗?
Innocent?

541
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:08,025
我是肖申克唯一的罪犯
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

542
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,008
彼德

543
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,055
班尼

544
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:07,034
A

545
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,008
歌女呢?
Where's the canary?

546
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:10,058
你怎么知道?
How did you know?

547
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:13,008
-我知道什么?  -原来你不知道
-How did I know what?  -So you don't know.

548
00:41:13,028 --> 00:41:14,044
来
Come.

549
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:19,005
歌女在这里
This is where the canary is.

550
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:25,006
没想到她来寒舍献唱吧
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?

551
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:29,096
的确...
That's quite a...

552
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,056
没想到
surprise.

553
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:36,010
瑞德
Red

554
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,027
等一下啦
Wait, wait.

555
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,030
她上场了
Here she comes.

556
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:43,044
我最迷她甩头发的骚样
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

557
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,038
这个月看过三场了
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

558
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:48,048
姬旦  你衣着整齐吗?
Gilda, are you decent?

559
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,061
我?
Me?

560
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,009
我爱死了
God, I love it.

561
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:03,026
听说阁下有求必应
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

562
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:08,000
在下确非浪得虚名  你要什么?
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

563
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,033
-丽塔海华丝  -什么?
-Rita Hayworth. -What?

564
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,027
弄得到吗?
Can you get her?

565
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:17,004
这位就是法罗呀  久仰
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

566
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:20,058
-要几个星期  -几星期?
-Take a few weeks. -Weeks?

567
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:25,019
我又没把她压在下面
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

568
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,000
沉住气哦  法罗先生

569
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,028
反正弄得到
But I'll get her.

570
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:28,062
安啦
Relax.

571
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:31,079
谢了
Thanks.

572
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,012
的确  你该见见他

573
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:37,006
说了我来做什么吗?

574
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,089
不  我要让他惊喜

575
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:54,015
-出去  -我得放映呀
-Get out!  -I got to change reels!

576
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,038
我叫你滚
I said fuck off!

577
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:03,089
你不尖叫吗?
Ain't you going to scream?

578
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:07,009
咱们算算总帐
Let's get this over with.

579
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,019
他打破我鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!

580
00:43:23,051 --> 00:43:24,074
现在...
Now...

581
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:27,038
我要解拉链
I'm going to open my fly...

582
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:30,041
叫你含什么你就含
and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

583
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:34,015
先舔我  再舔公鸡  因为你害他流鼻血
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.  You broke his nose.

584
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:36,048
你应该要道歉
He ought to have something to show for it.

585
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:38,056
它进我的嘴  就跟你分家
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

586
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:41,036
不  你没搞懂
No, you don't understand.

587
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,072
我会用钻子刺穿你耳朵
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

588
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:48,039
脑部遇袭...
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...

589
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,054
会使人死劲咬
causes the victim to bite down hard.

590
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:54,023
用力之大呀...
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

591
00:43:55,004 --> 00:43:57,054
得用铁撬...
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

592
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:59,008
才扳得开
with a crowbar.

593
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,058
你怎么知道?
Where do you get this shit?

594
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,019
书上写的
I read it.

595
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,042
你识字吗  豆腐脑?
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

596
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,002
亲爱的
Honey!

597
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,069
你不该损我
You shouldn't!

598
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:21,027
包格斯没逼他吹喇叭
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

599
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:23,060
其他两个也不敢
And neither did his friends.

600
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:27,087
他们把安迪打个半死
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

601
00:44:28,054 --> 00:44:31,004
在医务室里待了一个月
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

602
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,037
包格斯被罚独囚一周
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

603
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,098
时间到
Time's up, Bogs.

604

618
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:06,046
咱们欠他的酒
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

619
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:09,047

What are you, a fucking geologist?

626
00:46:57,056 --> 00:46:59,029
他说的没错
He's right. It ain't.

627
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,040
-那这是什么?  -马屎蛋
-What the hell is it then? -It's a horse apple.

628
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:05,077

715
00:53:37,086 --> 00:53:39,049
我在想...
I was thinking...

716
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:44,003
为孩子弄个教育基金

好的
So...

722
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,053
狄金斯先生...
Mister Dekins...

723
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:24,046
然后安迪说...
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

724
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:27,067
你想让公子进哈佛或耶鲁?
do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

725
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:28,093
你少瞎扯
He didn't say that!

726
00:54:29,028 --> 00:54:31,077
真的  老天为证
As God as my witness!

727
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,078
他愣了一下
Dekins blinked for a second...

728
00:54:33,098 --> 00:54:37,028
傻笑出来  后来他真的跟安迪握手
then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

729
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,082
-握你的鸟  -真的握手
-My ass!  -Shook his hand.

730
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:42,096
我乐的差点尿出来
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

731
00:54:43,016 --> 00:54:47,042
若给安迪弄一套西装领带...
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

732
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:50,022
他就成了咨询先生
he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

733
00:54:50,043 --> 00:54:52,006
开始交新朋友了  安迪?
Making a few friends?

734
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:55,003
也不算朋友
I wouldn't say "friends."

735
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:59,007
我是精通理财的囚徒
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

736
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:01,061
这种本事很受用
It's a wonderful pet to have.

737
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,061
起码不用干洗衣工
Got you out of the laundry, though.

738
00:55:04,015 --> 00:55:06,005
还派得上更大用场
It might do more than that.

739
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,098
比如扩建图书馆  买新书
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.

740
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,078
还不如要个撞球桌
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

741
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:13,034
对
yes

742
00:55:13,052 --> 00:55:16,049
你想怎么弄?
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

743
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:19,066
阁下想怎样买新书?
get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

744
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:22,019
找典狱长要钱
I'll ask the warden for funds.

745
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:27,033
少年呀  我经历六个典狱长
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

746
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,087
我学到互古不变的真理
one immutable, universal truth:

747
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:31,050
给钱是不可能的
Not one born whose asshole...

748
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:36,064
他们没一个生来有屁眼
wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

749
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:40,041
-预算太少了  -我了解
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.  -I see.

750
00:55:40,062 --> 00:55:44,005
我可以写信跟州议会要钱
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.

751
00:55:44,025 --> 00:55:48,035
监狱领到款只能做三种用途
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

752
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:50,099
筑高墙  加牢笼  添警卫
More walls, more bars, more guards.

753
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,086
我仍请您恩准  一周一信
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.

754
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:56,079
-总会有结果  -难说哦
-They can't ignore me forever.  -Sure can.

755
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,073
想写就写吧
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

756
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:02,063
我一定寄出  行吗?
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

757
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,010
安迪开始一周一信
So Andy started writing a letter a week...

758
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,090
他说话算话
just like he said.

759
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:15,071
不过  就像诺顿说的
And like Norton said...

760
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,041
毫无回音
Andy got no answers.

761
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:30,050
次年  他替半数的警卫报税
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

762
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:34,010
再过一年  全都找他帮忙
Year after that, he did them all...

763
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:36,027
包括典狱长的
including the warden's.

764
00:56:38,001 --> 00:56:41,046
再过一年的狱际棒球赛
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...

765
00:56:41,068 --> 00:56:44,011
改在与税季重叠
to coincide with tax season.

766
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:50,014
各监狱的警卫都带税单找他
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

767
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,068
狱方发枪给你...
So Moresby Prison...

768
00:56:51,089 --> 00:56:54,015
但要你付钱
issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

769
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:56,008
连枪套也要我付
Right. The holster too.

770
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:58,078
这笔钱可扣除
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

771
00:56:58,096 --> 00:57:01,099
没错  安迪就像家庭工业
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

772
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,019
税季繁忙时  还可请助手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

773
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:09,096
请帮我拿一叠表格
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

774
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:14,097
每年此时我调离工厂  我乐到心坎里
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

775
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:19,037
至于信  他仍继续寄
And still, he kept sending those letters.

776
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:27,018
瑞德  安迪  布鲁克出事了
It's Brooks.

777
00:57:28,032 --> 00:57:29,081
守着门
Watch the door.

778
00:57:30,006 --> 00:57:31,039
布鲁克
Please, Brooks.

779
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:33,046
-你他妈的别冲动嘛  -混帐  退后
-Calm the fuck down.  -Stay back!

780
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,052
-混蛋  退后!  -怎么了?
-Stay back, goddamn it!  -What's going on?

781
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:39,029
好好的  突然亮刀子
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

782
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,030
布鲁克  有话好说
We can talk about this, right?

783
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:45,030
放屁  没啥可说  我要割断他喉咙
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.

784
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:47,030
等一下  赫伍哪里不对?
What's he done to you?

785
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:49,017
错在他们
It's what they done!

786
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:50,094
我别无选择
I got no choice.

787
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,071
谁都知道你不会伤害他  对吗?
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.

788
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:56,041
-对  我了解  -为何你不会伤害他?
-Right, Heywood?  -Sure.

789
00:57:56,062 --> 00:57:59,095
因为他是朋友  而你明理
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

790
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:01,099
-有道理  对不对?  -对
Right, guys?

791
00:58:02,026 --> 00:58:04,078
布鲁克  看着我  放下刀
So put the knife down. Look at me.

792
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:07,026
那就把刀放下
Put the knife down.

793
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,029
布鲁克  你瞧他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

794
00:58:12,003 --> 00:58:14,037
他都流血了
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

795
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:16,076
只有闯祸...
It's the only way...

796
00:58:16,094 --> 00:58:19,000
才能留在牢里
they'd let me stay.

797
00:58:19,027 --> 00:58:21,064
怎么会?  别做傻事
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

798
00:58:21,088 --> 00:58:23,094
把刀放下吧
Put it, put it down.

799
00:58:32,072 --> 00:58:34,021
放轻松一点
Take it easy.

800
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:36,045
不会有事的
You'll be all right.

801
00:58:36,063 --> 00:58:39,012
他没事  我呢?
Him? What about me?

802
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:41,069
老疯狗差点割断我喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

803
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,080
你刮胡子不也刀刀见血
You've had worse from shaving.

804
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,009
你怎样惹毛他的?
What did you do to set him off?

805
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,053
哪有  我只是来道别
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

806
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:51,080
上面准他假释了
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

807
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:56,094
我实在搞不明白
I just don't understand what happened in there.

808
00:58:57,015 --> 00:58:59,094
这老家伙简直疯了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

809
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:02,005
赫伍  住口
That's enough out of you.

810
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:04,098
-听说你吓的屁滚尿流  -滚你的
-Heard he had you shitting your pants. -Fuck you.

811
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:06,045
别斗嘴了
IKnock it off.

812
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,086
布鲁克没疯
Brooks ain't no bug.

813
00:59:09,029 --> 00:59:10,038
他只是...
he is just...

814
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:14,046
体制化了
institutionalized.

815
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,077
什么鸟词儿嘛
"Institutionalized," my ass.

816
00:59:17,097 --> 00:59:21,096
他坐了50年的牢  50年呀
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!

817
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,090
成了井底之蛙
This is all he knows.

818
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:26,040
他念过书...
In here, he's an important man...

819
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:27,070
在狱中有地位
an educated man.

820
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:30,044
出狱就成了废人
Outside, he's nothing.

821
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:34,081
双手犯关节炎的囚徒
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

822
00:59:35,002 --> 00:59:38,001
想向图书馆借书都会被拒
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

823
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:40,002
这样说你懂吗?
You know what I'm trying to say?

824
00:59:40,029 --> 00:59:43,019
我才不懂你的满嘴屁话
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

825
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:46,069
随你怎么说
You believe whatever you want.

826
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,070
监狱是怪地方
But I tell you these walls are funny.

827
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,096
起先你恨它
First you hate them.

828
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,070
然后习惯它
Then you get used to them.

829
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:00,063
更久后...
Enough time passes...

830
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,030
你离不开他
you get so you depend on them.

831
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:06,051
这就叫体制化
That's "institutionalized."

832
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:08,001
狗屎
Shit.

833
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,098
-我才不会呢  -是吗?
-I could never get like that. -Oh, yeah?

834
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:14,034
等你待到布鲁克那把年纪 你就知道了
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

835
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:16,015
说的太对了
Goddamn right.

836
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,066
他们把你关一辈子
They send you here for life...

837
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:23,066
你的一生都被剥夺了
that's exactly what they take.

838
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,039
至少是一大部分
Part that counts, anyway.

839
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:37,095
杰克  我无法再照顾你
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

840
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,078
走吧  你自由了
You go on now.

841
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:43,051
自由了
You're free.

842
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,034
自由了
You're free.

843
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:07,004
一切顺利  布鲁克
Good luck, Brooksie.

844
01:01:09,034 --> 01:01:11,040
保重

845
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,050
亲爱的牢友...
Dear fellas:

846
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:50,098
外头的变化快的难以置信
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

847
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:54,095
老头子  嫌命长呀
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

848
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:59,068
小时候我只看过一辆汽车
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...

849
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,076
如今...满街都是
but now they're everywhere.

850
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:10,074
整个世界忙成一团
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

851
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:30,032
上面安排我...
The parole board got me into this halfway house...

852
01:02:30,063 --> 01:02:32,029
在中途之家
called "The Brewer"...

853
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:33,065
并在超市...
and a job...

854
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:36,083
当包装员
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

855
01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:40,080
工作辛苦  我很努力
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

856
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,037
但双手一直犯疼
..but my hands hurt most of the time.

857
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:45,064
叫他务必用双层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.

858
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:47,087
上次差点撑破袋子
Last time, the bottom near came out.

859
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:51,048
确定要用双层袋
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. understand?

860
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:53,005
是  没问题
Yes, sir. Surely will.

861
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:56,078
店长不怎么喜欢我
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

862
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:04,009
下工后我去公园喂鸟
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

863
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:06,002
盼望...
I keep thinking...

864
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:09,059
杰克来打个招呼
Jake might just show up and say hello.

865
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,019
但他没出现过
But he never does.

866
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,027
不管他在何处  我祝他过的好  有新朋友
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

867
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:24,061
我夜间难以入眠
I have trouble sleeping at night.

868
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:28,018
做着从高处坠落的恶梦
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

869
01:03:28,045 --> 01:03:30,068
醒时恐惧莫名
I wake up scared.

870
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:35,012
有时记不起身在何方
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

871
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:41,053
也许我该持枪抢劫
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

872
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:46,016
毙了店长  重回肖申克  杀了他锦上添花
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

873
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:51,083
我老的无法再胡闹了
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

874
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:53,080
我不喜欢这里
I don't like it here.

875
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:58,000
我厌倦成天担惊受怕
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...

876
01:03:58,085 --> 01:04:00,051
于是  我决心不再逗留
not to stay.

877
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:13,099
当局不会在乎我...
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

878
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,069
一个糟老头算什么
not for an old crook like me.

879
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:07,024
老布来此一游
Brook was here

880
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:24,043
当局不会在乎我  一个糟老头算什么
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

881
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:29,030
替我向赫伍道歉
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

882
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,084
别记恨在心
No hard feelings. Brooks."

883
01:05:42,032 --> 01:05:44,029
他还不如老死在肖申克好
He should have died in here.

884
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:51,022
你在干什么?
What the fuck have you done?

885
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:54,009
一片混乱
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

886
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:03,037
-这些是什么?  -你说呢  全是寄给你的
-What's all this?  -You tell me. They're addressed to you.

887
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:05,097
你看
Take it.

888
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:16,001
杜弗伦先生
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

889
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,012
鉴于你一再询问...
In response to your inquiries...

890
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:23,059
本州特拨款给贵图书馆
the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

891
01:06:24,036 --> 01:06:26,019
金额两百元
This is $ 200.

892
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,039
另外  主管单位...
"In addition, the library district has generously responded...

893
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,016
特地捐赠旧书及杂物
with a donation of used books and sundries.

894
01:06:33,037 --> 01:06:37,050
相信可满足阁下需要  就此结案
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

895
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:39,050
请勿再来信
Please stop sending us letters."

896
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:42,040
典狱长回来前清干净
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

897
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,080
是的
Yes, sir.

898
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,024
干的好  安迪
Good for you, Andy.

899
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:53,035
哇!
Wow!

900
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:56,049
只写了六年
It only took six years.

901
01:06:58,006 --> 01:07:00,079
现在起我一周两信
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

902
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,033
你真够固执的  听队长的话...
I believe you're crazy enough.  Get this stuff out...

903
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:07,003
把东西清干净  我去撇大条
like he said.I've got to pinch a loaf.

904
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:08,073
别让我出来...
When I come back...

905
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,067
再看到这些
this is all gone, all right?

906
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:39,063
贾各头漫划

907
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,082
安迪  什么声音?
Do you hear that?

908
01:09:09,056 --> 01:09:10,072
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

909
01:09:13,026 --> 01:09:14,079
安迪  放我出去
Andy, let me out!

910
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:19,013
安迪
Andy

911
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:26,061
我从未搞懂她们唱什么
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

912
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:29,014
其实我也不想弄懂
Truth is, I don't want to know.

913
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:31,084
此时无言胜有言
Some things are best left unsaid.

914
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:38,015
她们唱出...
I like to think it was something so beautiful...

915
01:09:38,035 --> 01:09:40,048
难以言传的美
it can't be expressed in words...

916
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:43,059
美的令你心碎
and makes your heart ache because of it.

917
01:09:45,026 --> 01:09:47,075
歌声直窜云端
I tell you, those voices soared...

918
01:09:48,003 --> 01:09:52,033
超越失意囚徒的梦想
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

919
01:09:52,053 --> 01:09:55,090
宛如小鸟飞入牢房
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...

920
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:58,087
使石墙消失无踪
and made those walls dissolve away.

921
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:01,050
就在这一瞬间
And for the briefest of moments...

922
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,070
肖申克众囚仿佛重获自由
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

923
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:09,094
典狱长可发飚了
It pissed the warden off something awful.

924
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:12,024
开门
Open the door.

925
01:10:15,016 --> 01:10:16,092
开门呀
Open it up!

926
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:20,096
杜弗伦  开门
Dufresne, open this door!

927
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,049
关掉
Turn that off!

928
01:10:30,057 --> 01:10:33,001
我警告你  关掉
I am warning you. Turn that off!

929
01:10:47,012 --> 01:10:49,009
杜弗伦
Dufresne

930
01:10:50,076 --> 01:10:52,028
敬酒不吃吃罚酒
You're mine now.

931
01:10:59,073 --> 01:11:02,097
安迪被罚囚两周
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

932
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:04,076
站起来
On your feet.

933
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,034
-看谁来了  -大指挥家
-Hey, look who's here.  -Maestro!

934
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:13,077
你没别的可放吗?  比如汉克威廉斯的歌
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?

935
01:11:14,012 --> 01:11:16,091
来不及接受点歌就被逮了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

936
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:20,025
-关两周值得吗?  -我最舒服的两周
-Was it worth two weeks?  -Easiest time I ever did.

937
01:11:20,046 --> 01:11:24,065
-屁话  独囚最难熬了  -在里面度日如年呀
-No such thing as easy time in the hole. -A week in the hole is like a year.

938
01:11:24,086 --> 01:11:28,016
-最难熬了  -有莫札特陪我
-Damn straight.  -I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

939
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:31,033
他们准你带电唱机?
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

940
01:11:33,077 --> 01:11:35,013
在脑中
It was in here.

941
01:11:35,097 --> 01:11:37,020
在心底
In here.

942
01:11:38,034 --> 01:11:40,043
音乐之美
That's the beauty of music. They...

943
01:11:40,064 --> 01:11:42,097
是夺不走的
can't get that from you.

944
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,088
你没体会过吗?
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

945
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:53,081
我年轻时吹口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

946
01:11:54,086 --> 01:11:56,055
没兴致了
Lost interest in it, though.

947
01:11:56,076 --> 01:11:58,035
在牢里也没意义
Didn't make much sense in here.

948
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:00,068
就是在这里才有意义
Here's where it makes the most sense.

949
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,029
有音乐才不会忘记
You need it so you don't forget.

950
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:05,006
忘记什么?
Forget?

951
01:12:05,043 --> 01:12:08,053
世上...
Forget that there are...

952
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,017
有些地方...
places...

953
01:12:10,067 --> 01:12:14,051
是石墙关不住的
in the world that aren't made out of stone.

954
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:17,000
在人的...
There's something...

955
01:12:17,035 --> 01:12:18,074
内心
inside...

956
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,098
有他们...
that they can't get to...

957
01:12:21,018 --> 01:12:22,055
管不到的东西
that they can't touch.

958
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:24,052
是完全属于你的
That's yours.

959
01:12:26,005 --> 01:12:27,065
你指什么?
What are you talking about?

960
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:29,092
希望
Hope.

961
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:32,032
希望
Hope.

962
01:12:34,026 --> 01:12:36,025
朋友  我告诉你
Let me tell you something, my friend.

963
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:39,036
有希望才危险
Hope is a dangerous thing.

964
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:42,087
希望能把人弄疯
Hope can drive a man insane.

965
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,073
希望无用
It's got no use on the inside.

966
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:48,014
你最好认命
You'd better get used to that idea.

967
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:52,014
要像布鲁克一样吗?
Like Brooks did?

968
01:13:17,051 --> 01:13:18,049
坐下
Sit down.

969
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:27,014
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满30年
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

970
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:30,038
你改过自新了吗?
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

971
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:31,081
是的
Oh, yes, sir.

972
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,042
我真的已经变好
Without a doubt.

973
01:13:35,059 --> 01:13:37,099
我完全洗心革面了
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

974
01:13:39,099 --> 01:13:41,093
我不会危害社会
No danger to society here.

975
01:13:42,046 --> 01:13:43,099
我向上帝发誓
God's honest truth.

976
01:13:46,057 --> 01:13:48,066
绝对改过自新了
Absolutely rehabilitated.

977
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:52,076
驳回

30年了
Thirty years.

979
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:03,092
老天  真不知该说什么?
Jesus, when you say it like that...

980
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,058
这些日子怎么熬过来的
You wonder where it went.

981
01:14:09,002 --> 01:14:11,018
我连前十年都不记得
I wonder where 10 years went.

982
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,019
拿去
Here.

983
01:14:17,063 --> 01:14:20,036
假释被拒的礼物
A little parole rejection present.

984
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:23,033
打开看看
Go ahead and open it.

985
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:26,046

Went through one of your competitors.

986
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:29,080

两百元无法打发安迪
they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.

当局决议每年付五百元...
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...

1000
01:16:49,048 --> 01:16:51,038
好让安迪封笔
just to shut him up.

1001
01:16:51,059 --> 01:16:54,058
你想像不到他的能耐
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

1002
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:57,072
他接洽读书会  慈善团体

01:17:40,017 --> 01:17:42,014
讲逃狱  你会喜欢
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

1020
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:46,024
那该归入教育类啰
We ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

大伙儿尽可能帮安迪

1025
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:05,033
甚至有汉克威廉斯精选集
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1026
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:14,063
就在同年...
That was also when Warden Norton...

1027
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:17,077
典狱长实施著名的外役专案
instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.

1028

他上了各报和《展望杂志》

1031
01:18:25,035 --> 01:18:28,058

对于纳税大众而言  也只花最少的代价
at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1039
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,094
当然  诺顿没向媒体说明
Of course he didn't tell the press...

1040
01:18:55,014 --> 01:18:58,060
"最少代价"实在含糊不清

揩油的方法何止百种

靠这么多奴工  谁标得过你
With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.

1046
01:19:15,073 --> 01:19:18,070
我们在提供社区服务
We're providing a valuable community service.

1047
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:23,030
这是广告词  但我得养家  山姆
That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

1048

1052
01:19:47,056 --> 01:19:50,026
别担心这项工程合约
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

1053
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:53,056
我已叫他们接别的案子了
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

1054
01:19:55,054 --> 01:19:58,060
帮我谢谢她的心意
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1055
01:19:59,071 --> 01:20:01,087
在每一桩买卖后面...
And behind every shady deal...

1056
01:20:02,021 --> 01:20:04,084
在每一元黑钱底下
behind every dollar earned...

1057
01:20:05,011 --> 01:20:08,017
都有安迪在  是他做的帐
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1058

1059
01:20:10,008 --> 01:20:14,021
照旧在夜间  存到常来往的银行
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.

1060
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:48,075
把东西拿去洗衣房  两套西装和杂物
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1061
01:20:49,022 --> 01:20:52,075
-别浆太硬  否则有他们好看  -是的  先生
If they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.

1062
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:54,029
我怎样?
How do I look?

1063
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:58,002
-很好  先生  -我去慈善宴会
-Very nice.  -Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1064
01:20:58,002 --> 01:20:59,055
州长会到
Governor will be there.

1065
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:02,046
剩下的给你吃
You want the rest of this?

1066
01:21:03,077 --> 01:21:05,071
烤的难吃透顶
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1067
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,027
谢谢您  先生
Thank you, sir.

1068
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:14,034
-这种派他收过很多  -你听说的只是皮毛
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1069
01:21:14,055 --> 01:21:19,038
他干的坏事你想不到  重重的回扣
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1070
01:21:19,059 --> 01:21:21,095
黑钱如河般在他脚下流
A river of dirty money running through here.

1071
01:21:22,016 --> 01:21:25,099
贪污这么多迟早会曝光
Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

1072
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:27,096
因此才要用我
That's where I come in.

1073
01:21:28,056 --> 01:21:30,086
我过滤黑钱  一一漂白
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1074
01:21:31,007 --> 01:21:33,090
股票  证券  市政公债
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1075
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:37,076
我让脏钱流入市场  等它回流时...
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...

1076
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:40,094
-干净的像处女?  -比那更干净
-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?  -Cleaner.

1077
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:45,014
诺顿退休时  将是百万富翁
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

1078
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:51,082
若被逮到  他也会被关入肖申克
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1079
01:21:52,009 --> 01:21:54,078
你对我这么没信心呀
I thought you had more faith in me than that.

1080
01:21:54,099 --> 01:21:58,002
不  我知道你很罩  但文件会留下证据
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.

1081
01:21:58,023 --> 01:22:01,063
万一调查局或国税局起疑...
Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...

1082
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,082
就完了
whatever.

1083
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:04,056
总有人要遭殃
It'll lead to somebody.

1084
01:22:04,077 --> 01:22:08,063
没错  但不是我  更不是典狱长
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.

1085
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:14,000
那是谁?
All right, who?

1086
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:15,080
兰道史帝文
Randall Stevens.

1087
01:22:16,028 --> 01:22:17,027
谁?
Who?

1088
01:22:17,048 --> 01:22:19,047
隐名又隐形的合伙人
The "silent" silent partner.

1089
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:22,074
法官  都怪他  户头是他的
He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.

1090
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:25,011
他是洗钱的起点
It's where the filtering process starts.

1091
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:28,019
出了差错  只追得到他
They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.

1092
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,002
但他是什么人?
But who is he?

1093
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:34,018
他是幻影  幽灵  兔宝宝的远房表亲
He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1094
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,046
我一手塑造他
I conjured him...

1095
01:22:36,066 --> 01:22:38,003
凭空的
out of thin air.

1096
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,056
他不存在  除了在文件上
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1097
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:47,000
哪有凭空造人的?
You can't just make a person up.

1098
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:50,030
利用制度的漏洞就行
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

1099
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:53,064
靠写信能办成太多的事
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1100
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:56,061
史帝文有出生证明
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1101
01:22:56,082 --> 01:22:58,094
有驾照  社会保险编号
driver's license, Social Security.

1102
01:22:59,022 --> 01:23:00,021
你没盖我吧?
You're shitting me.

1103
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:03,079
就算抓到蛛丝马迹
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...

1104
01:23:03,099 --> 01:23:05,072
也等于捕捉影
a figment of my imagination.

1105
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:07,092
真想不到
Well, I'll be damned!

1106
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,099
我有称赞过你吧?
Did I say you were good?

1107
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:12,099
你简直是大艺术家
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1108
01:23:13,073 --> 01:23:15,046
可笑的是...
The funny thing is...

1109
01:23:15,067 --> 01:23:19,077
外头  我刚正不阿
on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

1110
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:22,051
进了牢  却大搞歪哥
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1111
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,068
你心安吗?
Ever bother you?

1112
01:23:34,012 --> 01:23:37,018
我没干坏事  只是洗钱
I don't run the scams.I just process the profits.

1113
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:39,045
也许这是强词夺理
A fine line, maybe...

1114
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:42,009
但我只手成立图书馆
but I also built that library...

1115
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:45,032
帮助囚友考取中学文凭
and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

1116
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,076
典狱长凭什么任我做?
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

1117
01:23:47,097 --> 01:23:50,016
为了使你...
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1118
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:51,086
乐于帮他洗钱
Money instead of sheets.

1119
01:23:52,021 --> 01:23:54,080
我算是便宜卖给他
Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.

1120
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:14,069
汤米在65年来到肖申克...
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...

1121
01:24:14,093 --> 01:24:17,016
犯了"破闯"判了两年
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1122
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,073
就是强行入侵他人公宅
That's breaking and entering to you.

1123
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,023
他在商店后门偷彩电时被逮
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

1124
01:24:24,067 --> 01:24:25,097
小庞克
Young punk.

1125
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,080
摇滚狂一个
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1126
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:29,053
跩得够可爱
cocky as hell.

1127
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:32,014
快啦  各位老兄  慢吞吞的
Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!

1128
01:24:32,038 --> 01:24:34,014
我看了难过
Making me look bad.

1129
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,015
人见人爱
We liked him immediately.

1130
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:40,011
我退出门外  我这样抱着电视
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

1131
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:44,005
它很大  害我看不见  忽然传出声音
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.

1132
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:46,066
"别动  手举起来"
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1133
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:51,032
我站着抱紧电视
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:

1134
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:55,033
他又说"你听没有?"  我说有  但我若松手
"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1135
01:24:55,054 --> 01:24:58,099
就一条毁损财产罪
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."

1136
01:25:03,048 --> 01:25:05,078
你在凯希曼监狱蹲过?
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

1137
01:25:06,028 --> 01:25:10,024
那是最好混的日子
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

1138
01:25:10,052 --> 01:25:12,045
周末回家  外役制度
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1139
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:13,071
不像这里
Not like here.

1140
01:25:13,092 --> 01:25:16,036
你哪里都蹲过嘛
Sounds like you done time all over.

1141
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:19,019
我13岁起以牢为家
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1142
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:21,059
你想的到的监狱我都待过
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1143
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,046
也许你该改行了
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1144
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,046
依我看
What I mean is...

1145
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,024
你的贼功不灵光  该做做别的事
you're not a very good thief.You should try something else.

1146
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:34,070
你懂个屁  你是卡彭呀?
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?

1147
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:36,070
你为何入狱?
What are you in for?

1148
01:25:36,098 --> 01:25:37,097
我?
Me?

1149
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,008
被律师害了
A lawyer fucked me.

1150
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:48,096
肖申克没人有罪  你不懂吗?
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

1151
01:25:56,086 --> 01:26:01,027
汤米有娇妻和一女儿
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

1152
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:03,096
他怕妻女流落街头
Maybe he thought of them on the streets...

1153
01:26:04,017 --> 01:26:06,066
不认识老爸
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1154
01:26:06,097 --> 01:26:08,034
或是别的原因
Whatever it was...

1155
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:11,011
反正这小子卯上了
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1156
01:26:14,095 --> 01:26:17,082
我想考同等学历
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

1157
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:20,054
听说你帮过人
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1158
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:24,012
我不帮废人
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1159
01:26:25,053 --> 01:26:28,002
我才不是废人
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1160
01:26:29,076 --> 01:26:31,059
-你有心?  -对
-You mean that?  -Yeah.

1161
01:26:33,027 --> 01:26:34,070
真的有心?
You really mean that?

1162
01:26:35,074 --> 01:26:37,010
是的  我有
Yes, sir, I do.

1163
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,027
好  要冲就冲到底
Good. Because if we do this...

1164
01:26:39,047 --> 01:26:43,043
百分之百  不可退却
we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1165
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:45,047
问题是...
Thing is, see...

1166
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,027
我不太识字
I don't read so good.

1167
01:26:49,045 --> 01:26:50,054
没关系
"Well."

1168
01:26:52,055 --> 01:26:54,028
你...
You don't read...

1169
01:26:54,052 --> 01:26:56,005
不识字
so well.

1170
01:26:58,039 --> 01:26:59,088
交给我吧
We'll get to that.

1171
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:06,046
安迪收汤米为徒
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1172
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:09,030
从字母教起
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1173
01:27:11,044 --> 01:27:13,063
汤米学的非常好
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1174
01:27:13,091 --> 01:27:16,067
他从未发现自己有天份
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1175
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:22,045
没多久就始准备应试
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

1176
01:27:22,065 --> 01:27:24,031
安迪真心喜欢他
He really liked the kid.

1177
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:28,008
助人向上令他兴奋
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

1178
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:30,085
但动机不止于此
But that wasn't the only reason.

1179
01:27:31,056 --> 01:27:33,075
牢狱生活缓慢得很
Prison time is slow time.

1180
01:27:34,023 --> 01:27:36,082
必须找事打发时间
So you do what you can to keep going.

1181
01:27:37,016 --> 01:27:39,022
有人集邮
Some fellas collect stamps.

1182
01:27:39,063 --> 01:27:42,012
有人盖火柴屋
Others build matchstick houses.

1183
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:45,037
安迪成立了图书馆
Andy built a library.

1184
01:27:45,087 --> 01:27:47,081
如今他需要新计划
Now he needed a new project.

1185
01:27:48,068 --> 01:27:50,017
就是汤米
Tommy was it.

1186
01:27:50,081 --> 01:27:54,080
这跟他长年刻石一样
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

1187
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:58,058
也跟他挂美女图一样
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1188
01:27:59,049 --> 01:28:00,075
在牢里
In prison...

1189
01:28:01,002 --> 01:28:04,075
没事也得找事做
a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

1190
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:10,039
1966年  就在汤米应考之前...
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...

1191
01:28:10,063 --> 01:28:12,083
换上拉寇儿薇芝了
it was lovely Raquel.

1192
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:30,037
时间到
Time.

1193
01:28:36,042 --> 01:28:37,041
怎样?
Well?

1194
01:28:39,003 --> 01:28:41,015
烂透了
Well, it's for shit.

1195
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,049
我他妈白费一整年
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

1196
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:46,019
也许没那么糟
It's probably not that bad.

1197
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:50,063
更糟啦  没一题做对  简直像中文一样看不懂
I didn't get a thing right.It might as well have been in Chinese.

1198
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:52,057
分数出来再说
Let's see how the score comes out.

1199
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:55,074
我告诉你几分吧
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

1200
01:28:57,068 --> 01:28:59,004
两分入网
Two points, right there!

1201
01:28:59,025 --> 01:29:00,080
这就是分数
There's your goddamn score!

1202
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:04,075
什么猫爬树  五五二十五
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,5 times 5 is 25...

1203
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:07,031
去他妈的蛋
Fuck this place!

1204
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,068
去他妈的
Fuck it!

1205
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:29,010
真后悔
I feel bad.

1206
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:30,050
让他失望
I let him down.

1207
01:29:30,071 --> 01:29:32,044
胡说
That's crap, kid.

1208
01:29:32,065 --> 01:29:33,098
他以你为荣
He's proud of you.

1209
01:29:34,031 --> 01:29:37,018
多年的交情  我摸透他了
We're old friends,I know him as good as anybody.

1210
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,094
他是聪明人
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1211
01:29:39,015 --> 01:29:42,028
绝顶聪明  曾是银行家
Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.

1212
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:44,072
他究竟为何入狱?
What's he in here for anyway?

1213
01:29:45,003 --> 01:29:46,001
谋杀
Murder.

1214
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,086
你少扯了
The hell, you say.

1215
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,033
看他外表是想不到
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1216
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:58,066
捉到老婆跟高球教练在床  两个全干了
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1217
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,067
怎么了?
What?

1218
01:30:09,002 --> 01:30:11,058
大约四年前...
About four years ago...

1219
01:30:11,085 --> 01:30:15,008
我在汤犸斯监狱服刑
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1220
01:30:15,059 --> 01:30:16,089
我偷了车
I stole a car.

1221
01:30:17,026 --> 01:30:19,025
实在愚蠢
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1222
01:30:19,093 --> 01:30:22,016
剩下半年时...
About six months left to go...

1223
01:30:22,046 --> 01:30:24,036
来了新室友
I get a new cellmate in.

1224
01:30:25,007 --> 01:30:26,069
名叫厄摩
Elmo Blatch.

1225
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,073
大个子  紧张狂
Big, twitchy fucker.

1226
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:33,010
谁都怕碰上这种室友
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

1227
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:36,004
入室行窃  服刑6至12年
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1228
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:38,057
他说他干过好几百票
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1229
01:30:38,078 --> 01:30:43,072
想不到有那么神经的人  闻到屁味也跳到半天高
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1230
01:30:44,078 --> 01:30:49,041
他的嘴永远闭不上
Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1231
01:30:49,062 --> 01:30:51,025
他去过的地方...
Places he'd been in...

1232
01:30:51,056 --> 01:30:54,062
犯的罪  玩过的女人
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1233
01:30:54,086 --> 01:30:57,006
甚至杀过的人
Even people he killed.

1234
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,010
他说杀人
People who "gave him shit."

1235
01:31:01,074 --> 01:31:03,029
是因为不爽
That's how he put it.

1236
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:07,097
有一晚  我当做玩笑
So one night, like a joke...

1237
01:31:09,008 --> 01:31:12,057
我问他"你杀过谁?"
I say to him,"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1238
01:31:12,081 --> 01:31:13,090
他说...
So he says:

1239
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:18,007
我在俱乐部收盘子
I got me this job one time,busing tables at a country club...

1240
01:31:18,075 --> 01:31:22,065
趁机观察阔人下手
so I could case all these bigrich pricks that come in.

1241
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:26,075
我相中一人
So I pick out this guy...

1242
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:29,022
在晚上...
go in one night...

1243
01:31:29,043 --> 01:31:31,016
摸进他家
and do his place.

1244
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,093
他醒来...
He wakes up...

1245
01:31:34,067 --> 01:31:36,043
惹的我不爽
and gives me shit.

1246
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,017
我就宰了他
So I killed him.

1247
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:43,077
和他身边那骚货
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1248
01:31:45,018 --> 01:31:47,044
精彩的是...
And that's the best part.

1249
01:31:48,011 --> 01:31:50,061
她搞上高球教练
She's fucking this prick, see...

1250
01:31:50,078 --> 01:31:53,084
家有老公
this golf pro,but she's married to some other guy.

1251
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:57,001
一个大银行家
Some hotshot banker.

1252
01:31:58,046 --> 01:32:00,095
却成了代罪羔羊
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1253
01:32:12,044 --> 01:32:16,031
我从未听过如此惊人的故事
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1254
01:32:17,058 --> 01:32:20,007
最惊人的是你居然受骗
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

1255
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:21,080
什么?
Sir?

1256
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:27,061
显然汤米对你颇有好感
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

1257
01:32:28,022 --> 01:32:32,016
知道你痛苦  自然想让你高兴
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1258
01:32:32,036 --> 01:32:34,052
他还小  脑筋不太灵光
He's young, not terribly bright.

1259
01:32:35,006 --> 01:32:38,050
根本不明会害苦了你
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

1260
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,046
他说的是实情
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1261
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:45,040
就算真有厄摩这人
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

1262
01:32:45,067 --> 01:32:50,030
难道他会跪地哭诉  "是我杀的  我忏悔"
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1263
01:32:50,051 --> 01:32:53,021
"顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧"
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

1264
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:56,021
这无所谓 只要有汤米的证词 我就可以要求重审
With Tommy's testimony,I can get a new trial.

1265
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,091
但你得找到厄摩
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1266
01:32:59,012 --> 01:33:01,005
他可能早就出狱了
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1267
01:33:01,025 --> 01:33:05,085
但能查到住址和亲友  这是机会呀
They'd have his last known address.It's a chance, isn't it?

1268
01:33:08,019 --> 01:33:09,092
你真是个阿呆
How can you be so obtuse?

1269
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:11,085
什么?
What?

1270
01:33:13,037 --> 01:33:14,086
你说我什么?
What did you call me?

1271
01:33:15,004 --> 01:33:16,076
你笨蛋  我说错了吗?
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1272
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:18,063
你别忘了身份
You're forgetting yourself.

1273
01:33:18,097 --> 01:33:21,091
俱乐部有厄摩的资料
The country club will have his old timecards.

1274
01:33:22,011 --> 01:33:24,087
还有记录  税单
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1275
01:33:25,008 --> 01:33:27,077
你爱幻想  那是你的事
If you want to indulge this fantasy,it's your business.

1276
01:33:27,098 --> 01:33:30,058
别给我添麻烦  面谈结束
Don't make it mine.This meeting is over.

1277
01:33:30,078 --> 01:33:33,038
我若出狱  绝不提你的事
If I got out, I'd never mentionwhat happens here.

1278
01:33:34,002 --> 01:33:36,099
我洗钱  与你同罪
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

1279
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:41,079
不许你说钱这个字  兔崽子
Don't ever mention money to me,you son of a bitch!

1280
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,066
到哪里...
Not in this office...

1281
01:33:43,086 --> 01:33:45,080
都不许说  进来
not anywhere.Get in here, now!

1282
01:33:46,003 --> 01:33:48,073
我只想让你安心
I just wanted to put you at ease,that's all.

1283
01:33:49,037 --> 01:33:51,046
-独囚一个月  -是的
Solitary. A month.

1284
01:33:51,064 --> 01:33:54,044
-你是怎么搞的?  -带走
-what's wrong with you? -Get him out of here.

1285
01:33:54,064 --> 01:33:58,020
这是我重获自由的机会  你不懂吗?这是我的人生
This is my chance to get out!It's my life! Understand?!

1286
01:33:58,041 --> 01:34:00,047
带出去
Get him out!

1287
01:34:02,025 --> 01:34:04,022
独囚一个月
A month in the hole.

1288
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:07,011
没听过这么久的处罚
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

1289
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:08,062
都是我不对
It's all my fault.

1290
01:34:08,082 --> 01:34:10,041
胡说八道
Bullshit.

1291
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:13,079
你没杀人  也没判安迪的罪
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

1292
01:34:13,099 --> 01:34:16,039
你是说安迪没罪?
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1293
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,062
他真的无辜?
I mean, for real innocent?

1294
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:20,016
看来是这样
It looks that way.

1295
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,050
我的天呀
Sweet Jesus.

1296
01:34:22,077 --> 01:34:24,060
他服刑多久了?
How long has he been here now?

1297
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,027
47年进来  19年了
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1298
01:34:28,051 --> 01:34:31,010
-汤米的信  -在这里
-Williams, Thomas.  -Yeah, over here.

1299
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:38,011
是什么?
What you got?

1300
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:40,008
教育委员会来的
Board of Education.

1301
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:41,081
老小子寄出那考卷了
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1302
01:34:42,002 --> 01:34:45,098
-没错  -你要拆  或是拿着傻看?
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

1303
01:34:46,019 --> 01:34:48,035
拿着看好些
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1304
01:34:48,086 --> 01:34:51,070
拿来啦  痞子
Skeets, come on.Give me that, you shithead.

1305
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:53,086
福洛
Floyd, come on.

1306
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:58,003
瑞德
Red

1307
01:34:59,031 --> 01:35:01,071
把它丢掉  好吗?
Will you throw that away, please?

1308
01:35:07,031 --> 01:35:09,004
真不错
Well, shit.

1309
01:35:21,073 --> 01:35:24,053
他考取了  平均丙上
The kid passed. C + average.

1310
01:35:24,073 --> 01:35:26,082
跟你报个喜
Thought you'd like to know.

1311
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:44,054
典狱长找你谈话
Warden wants to talk.

1312
01:35:58,026 --> 01:35:59,032
在这儿?
Out here?

1313
01:35:59,053 --> 01:36:01,076
他是这样说的
That's what the man said.

1314
01:36:17,088 --> 01:36:18,087
典狱长
Warden?

1315
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:20,075
汤米

1316
01:36:27,026 --> 01:36:32,096
汤米  这次会面要你守密
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

1317
01:36:34,047 --> 01:36:36,073
我良心深感不安
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1318
01:36:55,019 --> 01:36:57,025
他的判决出了问题
We got a situation here.

1319
01:36:58,012 --> 01:37:00,022
我想你明白
I think you can appreciate that.

1320
01:37:00,043 --> 01:37:01,065
是的
Yes, sir.

1321
01:37:01,093 --> 01:37:03,033
我明白
I sure can.

1322
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:07,062
这件事真的使我震惊
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

1323
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:11,066
我连觉都睡不好
It's got me up nights.That's the truth.

1324
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:15,077
我该怎么做才好
The right thing to do...

1325
01:37:17,044 --> 01:37:21,017
有时连我也不清楚
sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1326
01:37:22,018 --> 01:37:23,061
你了解吗?
Do you understand?

1327
01:37:25,092 --> 01:37:27,051
我需要你的协助
I need your help, son.

1328
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:31,012
我要有...
If I'm going to move on this...

1329
01:37:31,046 --> 01:37:34,062
十足把握才能翻案
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1330
01:37:35,036 --> 01:37:36,042
我得知道
I have to know...

1331
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:39,026
你是否说实话
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1332
01:37:39,047 --> 01:37:40,059
是的
Yes, sir.

1333
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,003
字字属实
Absolutely.

1334
01:37:42,054 --> 01:37:45,053
你愿在法官及陪审团前宣誓
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...

1335
01:37:45,074 --> 01:37:47,073
并且手按圣经
with your hand on the Good Book...

1336
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:50,060
在上主跟前起誓?
and take an oath before Almighty God himself?

1337
01:37:50,081 --> 01:37:52,061
我绝不迟疑
Just give me that chance.

1338
01:37:56,088 --> 01:37:58,021
我也是这样想
That's what I thought.

1339
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:47,020
相信你已听说了
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1340
01:38:48,097 --> 01:38:49,099
真惨
Terrible thing.

1341
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,009
英年早逝
A man that young...

1342
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:56,000
剩不到一年还要逃
less than a year to go, trying to escape.

1343
01:38:56,054 --> 01:38:59,003
射杀他令海利伤透心
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1344
01:38:59,078 --> 01:39:01,027
真的是这样
Truly, it did.

1345
01:39:04,028 --> 01:39:06,072
我们只有忘掉这事
We just have to put it behind us.

1346
01:39:08,039 --> 01:39:09,062
继续过日子
Move on.

1347
01:39:11,022 --> 01:39:12,071
到此为止
I'm done.

1348
01:39:14,003 --> 01:39:15,065
我不干了
Everything stops.

1349
01:39:17,063 --> 01:39:19,096
你找别人帮你诬钱
Get someone else to run your scams.

1350
01:39:21,023 --> 01:39:23,007
不会停止
Nothing stops.

1351
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,056
要继续
Nothing.

1352
01:39:28,098 --> 01:39:32,007
否则我要你生不如死
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1353
01:39:32,048 --> 01:39:34,078
不再让警卫保护你
No more protection from the guards.

1354
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:39,092
不再让你一人一间牢房  把你丢到鸡奸狂当中
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

1355
01:39:41,032 --> 01:39:43,075
日日夜夜轮奸不休
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1356
01:39:45,016 --> 01:39:46,065
图书馆呢?
And the library?

1357
01:39:47,033 --> 01:39:48,032
没了
Gone.

1358
01:39:48,093 --> 01:39:51,049
用砖头封死掉
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1359
01:39:51,096 --> 01:39:54,063
在操场焚书
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1360
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,096
几里外都看得见火光
They'll see the flames for miles.

1361
01:39:57,017 --> 01:40:00,000
大家围着火跳红蕃舞
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1362
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:04,027
我的话你懂吗?
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1363
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:09,088
我是呆瓜吗?
Or am I being obtuse?

1364
01:40:21,066 --> 01:40:24,029
再关他一个月考虑
Give him another month to think about it.

1365
01:41:11,004 --> 01:41:14,010
老婆说她很难了解我
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1366
01:41:14,091 --> 01:41:16,075
像一本合起来的书
Like a closed book.

1367
01:41:17,055 --> 01:41:19,058
她整天这样抱怨
Complained about it all the time.

1368
01:41:20,052 --> 01:41:22,008
她很漂亮
She was beautiful.

1369
01:41:24,049 --> 01:41:26,001
我多么爱她呀
God, I loved her.

1370
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:31,096
我只是不擅表达
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1371
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:36,036
是我杀了她
I killed her, Red.

1372
01:41:38,024 --> 01:41:40,003
枪不是我开的
I didn't pull the trigger...

1373
01:41:41,047 --> 01:41:43,020
但我害她离我远去
but I drove her away.

1374
01:41:44,071 --> 01:41:47,041
是我的脾气害她的
That's why she died, because of me...

1375
01:41:47,061 --> 01:41:48,098
死了她
the way I am.

1376
01:41:57,099 --> 01:41:59,082
但你不是杀人犯
That don't make you a murderer.

1377
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:04,096
也许不算是好丈夫
Bad husband, maybe.

1378
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:11,087
可以后悔  但你无罪
Feel bad about it if you want,but you didn't pull the trigger.

1379
01:42:12,007 --> 01:42:13,040
没错
No, I didn't.

1380
01:42:13,081 --> 01:42:15,074
是别人干的没错
Somebody else did.

1381
01:42:16,098 --> 01:42:19,007
但却由我受罚
And I wound up in here.

1382
01:42:21,055 --> 01:42:23,014
大概是我命薄
Bad luck, I guess.

1383
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
谁都可能...
It floats around.

1384
01:42:30,082 --> 01:42:33,005
沾染霉运
It's got to land on somebody.

1385
01:42:33,096 --> 01:42:35,086
刚好轮到我
It was my turn, that's all.

1386
01:42:36,056 --> 01:42:39,033
我被卷入龙卷风
I was in the path of the tornado.

1387
01:42:45,027 --> 01:42:49,023
只是没想到刮了这么久
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

1388
01:42:53,058 --> 01:42:55,027
你有可能假释吗?
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1389
01:42:56,052 --> 01:42:57,054
我?
Me?

1390
01:43:00,052 --> 01:43:01,051
有呀
Yeah.

1391
01:43:02,086 --> 01:43:05,015
要等我老的神智不清才行
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

1392
01:43:05,036 --> 01:43:09,045
我出狱后有地方去
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.

1393
01:43:10,056 --> 01:43:12,019
我跟你说我要去哪儿
I tell you where I'd go.

1394
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:15,033
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

1395
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:17,040
什么?
Say what?

1396
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:19,053
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

1397
01:43:20,047 --> 01:43:22,013
在墨西哥
It's in Mexico.

1398
01:43:23,051 --> 01:43:25,064
太平洋边的小地方
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1399
01:43:26,078 --> 01:43:30,072
-知道墨西哥人怎样说太平洋的吗?  -不知道
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?

1400
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,038
那是没有回忆的海洋
They say it has no memory.

1401
01:43:35,035 --> 01:43:38,002
我要在那度此余生
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1402
01:43:39,066 --> 01:43:42,015
没有回忆的温暖地
A warm place with no memory.

1403
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,033
在海边...
Open up a little hotel...

1404
01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:50,053
开个小旅馆
right on the beach.

1405
01:43:51,014 --> 01:43:53,033
买条破船
Buy some worthless old boat...

1406
01:43:53,087 --> 01:43:55,050
整修一新
and fix it up new.

1407
01:43:58,024 --> 01:43:59,047
载客出海
Take my guests out...

1408
01:44:00,031 --> 01:44:01,068
包船海钓
charter fishing.

1409
01:44:05,052 --> 01:44:07,025
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

1410
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,066
你在那地方也大有可为
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

1411
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,003
我在外头吃不开的
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

1412
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:32,077
我一生都耗在肖申克
I been in here most of my life.

1413
01:44:34,021 --> 01:44:35,098
我已体制化了
I'm an institutional man now.

1414
01:44:36,088 --> 01:44:38,061
就像布鲁克
Just like Brooks was.

1415
01:44:40,009 --> 01:44:41,078
你别小看自己
You underestimate yourself.

1416
01:44:42,036 --> 01:44:43,095
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

1417
01:44:47,079 --> 01:44:51,073
我在牢里让你有求必应
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...

1418
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:55,002
一出社会电话簿里样样有
outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1419
01:44:55,023 --> 01:44:57,046
但我连查都不会查
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

1420
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:01,023
太平洋?
Pacific Ocean?

1421
01:45:01,064 --> 01:45:02,087
狗屁
Shit.

1422
01:45:03,024 --> 01:45:05,044
大的我心都毛了
Scare me to death, something that big.

1423
01:45:05,064 --> 01:45:06,094
我不会
Not me.

1424
01:45:08,015 --> 01:45:10,091
老婆和她情夫不是我杀的
I didn't shoot my wife,and I didn't shoot her lover.

1425
01:45:12,065 --> 01:45:15,088
我犯的错已偿清
Whatever mistakes I made,I've paid for them and then some.

1426
01:45:16,092 --> 01:45:18,041
一间旅店  一叶扁舟
That hotel, that boat...

1427
01:45:20,019 --> 01:45:22,042
这种要求并不过份
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1428
01:45:27,033 --> 01:45:29,077
你不该有此妄想
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1429
01:45:29,097 --> 01:45:31,099
完全痴人说梦
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1430
01:45:32,044 --> 01:45:34,093
墨西哥和这儿是
Mexico is way down there and you're in here...

1431
01:45:35,011 --> 01:45:36,067
天南地北
and that's the way it is.

1432
01:45:37,001 --> 01:45:39,084
话是没错
Yeah, right.That's the way it is.

1433
01:45:41,035 --> 01:45:43,075
远在天涯海角
It's down there and I'm in here.

1434
01:45:46,032 --> 01:45:49,005
反正人只要二选一
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

1435
01:45:51,096 --> 01:45:53,045
忙着活...
Get busy living...

1436
01:45:54,083 --> 01:45:56,085
或忙着死
or get busy dying.

1437
01:46:00,043 --> 01:46:01,066
安迪
Andy

1438
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:06,053
瑞德
Red

1439
01:46:08,097 --> 01:46:11,070
等你假释后  帮我个忙
If you ever get out of here,do me a favor.

1440
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:14,018
没问题  你说
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1441
01:46:16,005 --> 01:46:19,092
在巴克斯顿有个大干田  知道巴克斯顿吗?
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.You know where Buxton is?

1442
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,052
-那一带田多得很  -有一处与众不同
-A lot of hayfields up there. -One in particular.

1443
01:46:24,072 --> 01:46:28,066
它有长石墙  北端有大橡树
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

1444
01:46:28,086 --> 01:46:31,073
美得像福斯特的诗
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1445
01:46:32,067 --> 01:46:35,016
我在那儿向她求婚
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1446
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:38,066
我们去野餐...
We went there for a picnic...

1447
01:46:39,007 --> 01:46:41,016
在橡树下野合 (野合:一种低于正当礼仪的婚配)
and made love under that oak...

1448
01:46:41,084 --> 01:46:44,007
我开口  她首肯
and I asked and she said yes.

1449
01:46:48,008 --> 01:46:49,091
答应我  瑞德
Promise me, Red.

1450
01:46:50,075 --> 01:46:52,038
如果你终于假释了
If you ever get out...

1451
01:46:52,059 --> 01:46:54,008
去找到那个地方
find that spot.

1452
01:46:55,025 --> 01:47:00,009
在石墙底有一颗奇石
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

1453
01:47:01,023 --> 01:47:04,025
黑色的火山玻璃
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1454
01:47:06,093 --> 01:47:09,059
底下埋着东西给你
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

1455
01:47:10,037 --> 01:47:11,060
什么?
What, Andy?

1456
01:47:12,004 --> 01:47:13,077
你埋着什么?
What's buried under there?

1457
01:47:15,037 --> 01:47:17,024
你搬开它...
You'll have to pry it up...

1458
01:47:17,044 --> 01:47:18,071
就知道
to see.

1459
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:26,055
你们听我说
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1460
01:47:27,022 --> 01:47:28,095
他胡言乱语
He's talking funny.

1461
01:47:30,006 --> 01:47:31,075
我真担心他
I'm really worried about him.

1462
01:47:32,016 --> 01:47:33,059
我们要盯紧他
Let's keep an eye on him.

1463
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:37,006
白天不要紧  晚上孤伶伶的
That's fine during the day,but at night he's all alone.

1464
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:39,062
天哪
Oh, Lord.

1465
01:47:40,097 --> 01:47:42,056
怎么了?
What?

1466
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:46,007
安迪今天到载货区
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1467
01:47:46,027 --> 01:47:48,037
向我要一条绳子

1468
01:47:48,057 --> 01:47:51,027
-绳子?  -六尺长
Rope? Six feet long.

1469
01:47:51,051 --> 01:47:52,088
你给了他?
And you gave it to him.

1470
01:47:53,075 --> 01:47:55,054
我凭什么不给?
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1471
01:47:55,075 --> 01:47:59,068
-天  赫伍呀  -怎么想的到?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?

1472
01:48:00,009 --> 01:48:01,064
你忘了布鲁克?
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1473
01:48:01,082 --> 01:48:05,059
不  安迪不会寻短
Andy would never do that.

1474
01:48:06,019 --> 01:48:07,025
绝对不会
Never.

1475
01:48:09,033 --> 01:48:10,066
谁知道呢?
I don't know.

1476
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,052
人的忍耐是有限度的
Every man has his breaking point.

1477
01:48:17,087 --> 01:48:20,013
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split.Want to get home.

1478

01:48:52,087 --> 01:48:55,081
-擦的雪亮  -是的
-I want them looking like mirrors. -Yes, sir.

1483
01:49:01,031 --> 01:49:02,080
你回来真好  安迪
It's good having you back.

1484
01:49:03,072 --> 01:49:05,058
没有你差多了
Place wasn't the same without you.

1485
01:49:52,046 --> 01:49:53,052
熄灯
Lights out!

1486
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:28,089
我也曾熬过孤寂长夜
I've had some long nights in stir.

1487
01:50:29,044 --> 01:50:32,010
独自在内心东想西想
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...

1488
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:34,097
时间慢的如同刀割
time can draw out like a blade.

1489
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:43,030
那是我毕生最长的一夜
That was the longest night of my life.

1490
01:50:59,016 --> 01:51:00,032
回报
Give me a count!

1491
01:51:04,084 --> 01:51:08,064

三北层到齐

1493
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:13,097
二层245房没人
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1494
01:51:14,018 --> 01:51:15,024
杜弗伦
Dufresne!

1495
01:51:15,078 --> 01:51:18,022
别让大家等你
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1496
01:51:21,035 --> 01:51:24,075
别让大家等你  等我找上来你就没命
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!

1497
01:51:32,033 --> 01:51:36,017
我还得等你一个  你敢耽搁我时间
Damn it, you're putting me behind!I got a schedule to keep.

1498
01:51:36,037 --> 01:51:39,067
你若没死没病  就倒霉了
You'd better be sick or dead in there.I shit you not!

1499
01:51:39,087 --> 01:51:41,020
听见没有?
You hear me?

1500
01:51:47,031 --> 01:51:49,041
我的老天爷
Oh, my Holy God.

1501
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,096
这一区每人都要问
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

1502
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,096
-先从他朋友开始  -谁?
-Start with that friend of his. -Who?

1503
01:52:12,014 --> 01:52:13,054
他
him

1504
01:52:14,054 --> 01:52:16,010
打开237房
Open 237.

1505
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:23,027
什么叫做他不见了?  这算什么鬼话?
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?Don't say that to me.

1506
01:52:24,015 --> 01:52:25,048
你再说就试试看
Don't tell me that again.

1507
01:52:25,068 --> 01:52:26,071
但他真的不见了
But sir, he wasn't.

1508
01:52:26,095 --> 01:52:30,041
我知道  我没眼睛吗?
I can see that, Haig!Think I'm blind?

1509
01:52:31,009 --> 01:52:32,049
你说我...
Is that what you're saying?

1510
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:35,035
-没长眼睛吗?  -不敢  长官
-Am I blind, Haig? -No, sir!

1511
01:52:36,026 --> 01:52:38,075
你呢? 你没长眼睛吗?
What about you. You blind?

1512
01:52:39,026 --> 01:52:41,082
-你说这是什么?  -昨晚的点名单
-Tell me what this is. -Last night's count.

1513
01:52:42,003 --> 01:52:45,033
上面明明写着杜弗伦
You see Dufresne's name there?I sure do. Right there.

1514
01:52:45,054 --> 01:52:46,087
"杜弗伦"
"Dufresne."

1515
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:50,003
熄灯时...
He was in his cell...

1516
01:52:50,024 --> 01:52:51,027
他在房里
at lights out.

1517
01:52:51,044 --> 01:52:54,038
早上也应该在才对
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1518
01:52:54,071 --> 01:52:56,034
把他找到
I want him found.

1519
01:52:56,055 --> 01:53:00,001
一刻不能拖  现在找
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1520
01:53:00,025 --> 01:53:01,045
是的
Yes, sir.

1521
01:53:02,045 --> 01:53:06,025
搜人去  快点
Let's go. Move your butts.

1522
01:53:08,013 --> 01:53:09,012
站住
Stand.

1523
01:53:10,056 --> 01:53:11,062
你说?
Well?

1524
01:53:15,007 --> 01:53:16,006
说什么?
Well, what?

1525
01:53:16,027 --> 01:53:19,073
你们俩成天粘在一起
I see you two all the time.You're thick as thieves, you are.

1526
01:53:20,081 --> 01:53:22,030
他一定说过什么
He must have said something.

1527
01:53:23,004 --> 01:53:24,057
报告典狱长
No, sir, Warden.

1528
01:53:24,091 --> 01:53:25,090
没有
Not a word.

1529
01:53:27,075 --> 01:53:30,031
那真是奇迹了
Lord, it's a miracle!

1530
01:53:30,092 --> 01:53:33,048
人像屁一般凭空消失
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1531
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:35,031
不见踪影
Nothing left...

1532
01:53:36,015 --> 01:53:38,088
只剩一堆石头
but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1533
01:53:39,009 --> 01:53:41,082
还有墙上那骚货
And that cupcake on the wall.Let's ask her.

1534
01:53:42,003 --> 01:53:43,079
问她吧  也许她知道
Maybe she knows.

1535
01:53:44,003 --> 01:53:46,076
你说呀  短裤妞儿
What say there, fuzzy-britches?Feel like talking?

1536
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:49,050
她不会说的
Guess not.

1537
01:53:50,007 --> 01:53:52,026
别人不说  为何她要说
Why should she be any different?

1538
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:55,000
没错  你们有预谋
This is a conspiracy.

1539
01:53:55,064 --> 01:53:57,047
就是这样
That's what this is.

1540
01:53:58,008 --> 01:54:01,081
一个超级大阴谋
One big, damn conspiracy!

1541
01:54:02,008 --> 01:54:04,007
每个人都有份
And everyone's in on it!

1542
01:54:04,072 --> 01:54:05,088
包括她
Including her!

1543
01:54:40,092 --> 01:54:42,061
1966年...
In 1966...

1544
01:54:42,082 --> 01:54:45,022
安迪·杜弗伦逃离...
Andy Dufresne escaped...

1545
01:54:45,042 --> 01:54:46,098
肖申克监狱
from Shawshank Prison.

1546
01:54:49,023 --> 01:54:51,079
狱方只寻获泥囚衣
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1547
01:54:52,043 --> 01:54:53,096
一块肥皂
a bar of soap...

1548
01:54:54,017 --> 01:54:55,072
一把石捶
and an old rock hammer...

1549
01:54:55,093 --> 01:54:58,043
一把几乎解体的石捶
damn near worn down to the nub.

1550
01:55:02,091 --> 01:55:07,068
我曾夸口要花六百年才挖的通的隧道...
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1551
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:10,094
安迪花了不到20年
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1552
01:55:29,023 --> 01:55:31,053
他喜爱研究地质
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1553
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:35,047
碎石令他想一探究竟
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1554
01:55:35,087 --> 01:55:37,071
刑期如同...
An ice age here...

1555
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,063
冰河时代
million years of mountain building there.

1556
01:55:41,065 --> 01:55:44,048
地质学探讨压力及时间
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1557
01:55:45,032 --> 01:55:47,031
这就是凿通的关键
That's all it takes, really.

1558
01:55:48,005 --> 01:55:49,015
压力...
Pressure...

1559
01:55:49,079 --> 01:55:51,005
和时间
and time.

1560
01:55:52,039 --> 01:55:54,045
和一张够大的海报
That and a big goddamn poster.

1561
01:55:58,026 --> 01:55:59,042
就我说的
Like I said...

1562
01:55:59,093 --> 01:56:03,092
在牢里  没事也得找事做
in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

1563
01:56:06,074 --> 01:56:11,054
原来的安迪的嗜好...
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...

1564
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:14,001
就是一点一滴倾倒废土
a handful at a time.

1565
01:56:15,031 --> 01:56:17,037
大概就在汤米死后...
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1566
01:56:17,058 --> 01:56:20,055
安迪决定不再久留
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

1567
01:56:20,075 --> 01:56:23,031
动作快  我要回家
Lickety-split.I want to get home.

1568
01:56:24,006 --> 01:56:26,008
马上就好了
I'm just about finished, sir.

1569
01:56:47,055 --> 01:56:49,048
今晚要存三笔
Three deposits tonight.

1570
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,009
安迪遵命行事
Andy did like he was told.

1571
01:56:59,029 --> 01:57:02,078
把鞋子擦的雪亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

1572
01:57:06,047 --> 01:57:08,076
警卫都没注意
The guards simply didn't notice.

1573
01:57:09,007 --> 01:57:10,056
我也没有
Neither did I.

1574
01:57:10,074 --> 01:57:12,026
说真的
I mean, seriously...

1575
01:57:12,047 --> 01:57:15,046
谁会注意别人的鞋子
how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

1576
01:59:19,003 --> 01:59:22,019
安迪就这样爬向自由
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...

1577
01:59:22,043 --> 01:59:25,077
在恶臭中匍匐五百码
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1578
01:59:26,077 --> 01:59:29,010
要我爬才不干
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1579
01:59:33,051 --> 01:59:35,088
五百码
Five hundred yards.

1580
01:59:36,038 --> 01:59:39,044
五座橄榄球场宽
That's the length of five football fields.

1581
01:59:40,009 --> 01:59:42,065
几乎长达半里
Just shy of half a mile.

1582
02:00:37,088 --> 02:00:42,047
次日清晨  在拉寇儿坦露她的秘密之时...
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...

1583
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:45,061
一个从未现世的人
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

1584
02:00:45,085 --> 02:00:48,044
走进缅因国家银行
strolled into the Maine National Bank.

1585
02:00:49,002 --> 02:00:52,018
在那之前  他不是实体
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1586
02:00:52,076 --> 02:00:55,012
-只存在于文件上  -有何干贵?
-Except on paper. -May I help you?

1587
02:00:55,053 --> 02:00:57,046
他各种证件都有
He had all the proper ID...

1588
02:00:57,066 --> 02:01:01,036
驾照  出生证  社会保险卡
driver's license, birth certificate,Social Security card...

1589
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:04,033
签名分毫不差
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1590
02:01:04,054 --> 02:01:07,063
失去您的生意令我真心遗憾
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1591
02:01:07,084 --> 02:01:09,057
祝您侨居愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1592
02:01:10,038 --> 02:01:11,047
谢谢
Thank you.

1593
02:01:12,014 --> 02:01:13,030
一定的
I'm sure I will.

1594
02:01:14,021 --> 02:01:17,055
这是银行本票  就这样吗?
Here's your cashier's check, sir.Will there be anything else?

1595
02:01:17,075 --> 02:01:18,074
麻烦你
Please.

1596
02:01:19,032 --> 02:01:21,081
帮我寄出去好吗?
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1597
02:01:22,032 --> 02:01:23,051
乐意之至
I'd be happy to.

1598
02:01:25,032 --> 02:01:26,065
-再会  -保重
Good day, sir.

1599
02:01:27,059 --> 02:01:32,003
那天上午史帝文斯先后去了十多家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

1600
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:34,009
总共加起来
All told, he blew town...

1601
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:39,013
提走了诺顿的37万美金黑钱
with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1602
02:01:39,084 --> 02:01:42,060
作为十九年冤狱的补偿
Severance pay for 19 years.

1603
02:01:49,085 --> 02:01:52,004
早上好 这里是波特兰日报
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1604
02:01:52,045 --> 02:01:54,061
肖申克监狱  贪污谋杀

1605
02:02:03,016 --> 02:02:05,065
主的审判迅速降临

1606
02:02:21,078 --> 02:02:25,018
亲爱的典狱长  你说的对  得救之道  就在其中

1607
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:47,084
你是海利吗?  你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

1608
02:02:48,011 --> 02:02:52,054
从现在起 你所说的一切 都将可能成为法庭上对你不利的证词
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

1609
02:02:52,098 --> 02:02:57,044
当时我没有在场  后来听说...
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1610
02:02:57,065 --> 02:02:59,014
海利利被人带走的时候竟然哭得像个老娘们
when they took him away.

1611
02:03:05,002 --> 02:03:08,042
诺顿却无意乖乖就范
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1612
02:03:24,038 --> 02:03:25,074
诺顿
Samuel Norton.

1613
02:03:25,091 --> 02:03:28,034
诺顿  我们有逮捕令  开门
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1614
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:34,018
把门打开
Open the door.

1615
02:03:34,072 --> 02:03:35,098
我不清楚哪一把
I'm not sure which key.

1616
02:03:45,066 --> 02:03:48,033
诺顿 拒捕是罪上加罪
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1617
02:03:59,058 --> 02:04:03,004
我猜他脑中最后一件事...
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...

1618
02:04:03,025 --> 02:04:04,084
除了枪子儿...
other than that bullet...

1619
02:04:05,005 --> 02:04:09,049
就是在想安迪为何能整倒他
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1620
02:04:11,099 --> 02:04:15,045
典狱长见阎王之后不久
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...

1621
02:04:15,073 --> 02:04:17,079
我收到一张明信片
I got a postcard in the mail.

1622
02:04:19,026 --> 02:04:22,010
没写字  但有邮戳
It was blank,but the postmark said...

1623
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:24,043
来自德州汉考克堡
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1624
02:04:24,097 --> 02:04:26,033
汉考克堡
Fort Hancock...

1625
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:28,033
就在边境线上
right on the border.

1626
02:04:28,074 --> 02:04:30,073
是安迪出境的地方
That's where Andy crossed.

1627
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:35,044
一想到 他开着敞篷车 疾驶而去的神情
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...

1628
02:04:35,078 --> 02:04:38,001
我就忍不住发笑
it always makes me laugh.

1629
02:04:39,085 --> 02:04:41,041
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

1630
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:43,081
终于从臭气熏天的下水道里
who crawled through a river of shit...

1631
02:04:44,002 --> 02:04:46,042
清清白白的走了出来
and came out clean on the other side.

1632
02:04:47,026 --> 02:04:48,062
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

1633
02:04:49,043 --> 02:04:51,002
向太平洋驶去
headed for the Pacific.

1634
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,016
海利掐住他说...
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

1635
02:04:56,037 --> 02:05:00,017
"他活的不耐烦了"
He says, "I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

1636
02:05:00,037 --> 02:05:03,024
老友们常聊起他
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

1637
02:05:03,091 --> 02:05:05,060
他那些惊人之举
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1638
02:05:05,081 --> 02:05:08,078
"请我朋友喝啤酒吧"
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

1639
02:05:09,011 --> 02:05:10,077
真的做到了
And he got it!

1640
02:05:12,002 --> 02:05:14,042
他走了  有时...
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1641
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:16,012
令我感伤
Andy being gone.

1642
02:05:16,082 --> 02:05:20,095
有些鸟儿是不应该被关在笼子里的
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1643
02:05:21,043 --> 02:05:23,049
因为它们的羽毛太丰润了
Their feathers are just too bright.

1644
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,093
当他们飞走...
And when they fly away...

1645
02:05:27,037 --> 02:05:31,077
你会由衷地庆贺他获得自由
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1646
02:05:32,084 --> 02:05:34,010
无奈的是...
But still...

1647
02:05:34,057 --> 02:05:38,091
你得继续在这乏味之地苟活
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

1648
02:05:43,011 --> 02:05:45,048
我真怀念这位友伴
I guess I just miss my friend.

1649
02:06:09,094 --> 02:06:11,010
请坐
Please sit down.

1650
02:06:16,095 --> 02:06:18,051
阿里斯瑞丁
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1651
02:06:19,005 --> 02:06:22,032
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满40年
your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

1652
02:06:23,012 --> 02:06:25,025
你改过自新了吗?
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1653
02:06:27,013 --> 02:06:28,068
改过自新?
Rehabilitated?

1654
02:06:30,073 --> 02:06:32,063
噢 让我想想
Well, now, let me see.

1655
02:06:33,063 --> 02:06:35,096
我不大明白这个词的含义
I don't have any idea what that means.

1656
02:06:38,007 --> 02:06:40,033
就是说准备好重返社会
It means you're ready to rejoin society...

1657
02:06:40,091 --> 02:06:43,024
我当然明白你的意思 年轻人
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1658
02:06:45,041 --> 02:06:47,040
对我而言 这只是个术语
To me it's just a made-up word.

1659
02:06:48,075 --> 02:06:51,008
就像政治家那些术语
A politician's word so that...

1660
02:06:51,052 --> 02:06:55,004
使你们穿西装打领带的...
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

1661
02:06:55,052 --> 02:06:57,011
有活干
and have a job.

1662
02:06:59,009 --> 02:07:01,018
你到底想了解什么?
What do you really want to know?

1663
02:07:01,096 --> 02:07:03,093
我后悔犯罪吗?
Am I sorry for what I did?

1664
02:07:04,036 --> 02:07:05,052
你后悔吗?
Well, are you?

1665
02:07:07,043 --> 02:07:10,027
我没有一天不后悔
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1666
02:07:11,064 --> 02:07:15,009
但并非受惩罚才后悔
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

1667
02:07:18,058 --> 02:07:21,014
我回首前尘往事
I look back on the way I was then...

1668
02:07:23,028 --> 02:07:24,044
那个
a young...

1669
02:07:25,055 --> 02:07:29,004
犯下重罪的小笨蛋
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1670
02:07:32,006 --> 02:07:33,075
我想跟他沟通
I want to talk to him.

1671
02:07:35,069 --> 02:07:38,018
我试图讲道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

1672
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:40,083
让他明了
Tell him the way things are.

1673
02:07:42,093 --> 02:07:44,037
但我办不到
But I can't.

1674
02:07:46,057 --> 02:07:48,056
那个少年早就不见了
That kid's long gone...

1675
02:07:49,077 --> 02:07:52,054
只剩下我垂老之躯
and this old man is all that's left.

1676
02:07:53,095 --> 02:07:55,044
我得接受事实
I got to live with that.

1677
02:07:56,078 --> 02:07:58,048
改过自新?
Rehabilitated?

1678
02:07:58,085 --> 02:08:00,068
狗屁不通的词
It's just a bullshit word.

1679
02:08:01,062 --> 02:08:06,039
你盖章吧  别浪费我的时间
So you go on and stamp your forms,sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1680
02:08:07,063 --> 02:08:09,089
告诉你一句实话
Because to tell you the truth...

1681
02:08:10,023 --> 02:08:12,022
我他妈的不在乎
I don't give a shit.

1682
02:08:25,044 --> 02:08:27,000
核准
Approved

1683
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:24,007
老布到此一游
Brook was here

1684
02:09:38,075 --> 02:09:40,015
谢谢你
Here you go, miss.

1685
02:09:43,009 --> 02:09:44,011
可以上厕所吗?
Restroom break?

1686
02:09:49,093 --> 02:09:54,046
别要尿尿就来报告  要去就去  懂吗?
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1687
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:57,009
是的
yes

1688
02:10:07,051 --> 02:10:10,057
我报告了40年
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

1689
02:10:11,042 --> 02:10:14,041
没报告  一滴也挤不出
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1690
02:10:17,092 --> 02:10:20,008
我得面对残酷的事实
There's a harsh truth to face.

1691
02:10:21,076 --> 02:10:24,066
我根本混不下去
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

1692
02:10:32,054 --> 02:10:36,023
我一心想违犯假释
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...

1693
02:10:37,004 --> 02:10:39,053
也许能重返肖申克
so maybe they'd send me back.

1694
02:10:44,072 --> 02:10:47,015
活在恐惧中真是糟糕
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1695
02:10:48,005 --> 02:10:49,071
布鲁克体会过
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1696
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:51,086
他看透了
Knew it all too well.

1697
02:10:53,046 --> 02:10:56,086
我只想回到有意义的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

1698
02:10:57,030 --> 02:11:00,003
不必整天担惊受怕
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1699
02:11:02,003 --> 02:11:04,040
只有一件事阻止了我
Only one thing stops me.

1700
02:11:05,084 --> 02:11:08,024
我向安迪做的承诺
A promise I made to Andy.

1701
02:11:28,076 --> 02:11:29,089
到了
There it is.

1702
02:11:40,050 --> 02:11:42,017
非常感谢您
Much obliged, sir.

1703
02:11:51,022 --> 02:11:53,071
巴克斯顿
Buxton

1704
02:15:21,049 --> 02:15:22,075
亲爱的瑞德
Dear Red:

1705
02:15:22,099 --> 02:15:25,048
见到这封信的时候 你已经出狱了
If you're reading this,you've gotten out...

1706
02:15:25,066 --> 02:15:29,072
既然走了这么远的路 干脆再走远一点吧
and if you've come this far,maybe you'd come a bit further.

1707
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,049
你还记得那个地方的名字,是吗?
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1708
02:15:34,077 --> 02:15:36,026
芝华塔尼欧
Zihuatanejo.

1709
02:15:37,091 --> 02:15:41,050
你能帮我实现计划
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

1710
02:15:42,001 --> 02:15:45,054
我备妥棋盘等着你
I'll keep an eye out for you,and the chessboard ready.

1711
02:15:46,035 --> 02:15:47,075
记住,瑞德.
Remember, Red...

1712
02:15:48,009 --> 02:15:50,018
心怀希望是一件好事
hope is a good thing...

1713
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:52,038
也许是最好的事
maybe the best of things.

1714
02:15:52,059 --> 02:15:54,075
心怀希望 就永远有希望
And no good thing ever dies.

1715
02:15:55,029 --> 02:15:58,016
希望这封信 能让我再次见到你
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

1716
02:15:58,036 --> 02:16:00,009
一个健壮的你
and finds you well.

1717
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:01,083
你的朋友
Your friend...

1718
02:16:02,003 --> 02:16:03,019
安迪
Andy.

1719
02:16:37,003 --> 02:16:38,076
要么忙于生存
"Get busy living...

1720
02:16:38,097 --> 02:16:40,087
要么赶着去死
or get busy dying."

1721
02:16:43,057 --> 02:16:45,074
这话真他妈的精辟
That's goddamn right.

1722
02:16:48,031 --> 02:16:50,080
瑞德也来过

1723
02:16:50,098 --> 02:16:53,011
这是生平第二次
For the second time in my life...

1724
02:16:53,035 --> 02:16:55,091
我又犯了罪
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1725
02:16:56,099 --> 02:16:58,092
违反假释出城
Parole violation.

1726
02:16:59,059 --> 02:17:03,025
我怀疑警方会设路障逮我
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

1727
02:17:03,093 --> 02:17:05,095
我这种老贼可以免了
Not for an old crook like me.

1728
02:17:06,016 --> 02:17:08,019
德州汉考克堡
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1729
02:17:11,087 --> 02:17:16,060
我激动的坐不住不停地想
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1730
02:17:17,004 --> 02:17:20,037
自由人才会这么兴奋吧
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

1731
02:17:20,058 --> 02:17:23,007
踏上未知旅程的...
A free man at the start of a long journey...

1732
02:17:23,028 --> 02:17:25,087
自由人
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1733
02:17:28,089 --> 02:17:31,055
我希望成功越过边界
I hope I can make it across the border.

1734
02:17:33,006 --> 02:17:36,008
我希望能跟老友握握手
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1735
02:17:37,096 --> 02:17:42,002
我希望太平洋如梦中一般蓝
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

1736
02:17:43,087 --> 02:17:45,006
我希望...
I hope.

1737
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:23,090
谨此纪念亚伦格林
