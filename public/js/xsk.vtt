杜弗伦先生  请你描述...
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:16.092 align:middle line:90%
命案当晚和妻子争吵的情形
the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:18.092 align:middle line:90%
我们吵的很凶
It was very bitter.

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:24.079 align:middle line:90%
她说不怕我知道  她讨厌偷偷摸摸
She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.053 align:middle line:90%
她还说  想去雷诺市办离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:90%
-你怎样回答?  -我拒绝离婚
-What was your response?  -I told her I would not grant one.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.077 align:middle line:90%
"你别想活着去雷诺市"
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:40.017 align:middle line:90%
邻居作证你说过这句话
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.031 align:middle line:90%
也许吧
If they say so.

00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:45.011 align:middle line:90%
我气炸了  记不清楚
I really don't remember. I was upset.

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:48.071 align:middle line:90%
你们吵完以后呢?
What happened after you argued with your wife?

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:51.065 align:middle line:90%
她收拾行李
She packed a bag.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:55.045 align:middle line:90%
去跟昆丁先生住一起
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:59.076 align:middle line:90%
葛兰昆丁  乡村俱乐部的高球教练
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:90%
你最近才发现  他是你太太的情夫
whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.073 align:middle line:90%
你跟踪她吗?
Did you follow her?

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:10.004 align:middle line:90%
我先去酒吧买醉
I went to a few bars first.

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:14.097 align:middle line:90%
然后去他家  但没人在
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:17.027 align:middle line:90%
我停了车
I parked in the turnout...

00:03:17.027 --> 00:03:18.041 align:middle line:90%
等他们
and waited.

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.068 align:middle line:90%
用意何在?
With what intention?

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:23.025 align:middle line:90%
我不确定
I'm not sure.

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:24.097 align:middle line:90%
我醉了
I was confused...

00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:27.069 align:middle line:90%
糊里糊涂
drunk.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.009 align:middle line:90%
我想...
I think...

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.032 align:middle line:90%
最多只是吓吓他们
mostly I wanted to scare them.

00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:34.089 align:middle line:90%
结果他们一回来  你就冲进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.023 align:middle line:90%
不  我逐渐酒醒
I was sobering up.

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:90%
开车回家睡觉
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.027 align:middle line:90%
路中把枪丢入皇家河
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:46.051 align:middle line:90%
我已讲的很清楚
I've been very clear on this point.

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:50.078 align:middle line:90%
但清洁妇隔天早晨上工时
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:53.058 align:middle line:90%
发现床上的双尸
and finds your wife in bed with her lover...

00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:57.005 align:middle line:90%
身上满是点三八的弹孔
riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

00:03:57.005 --> 00:04:02.015 align:middle line:90%
你不觉得这很巧吗?  还是只有我这么想?
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:03.036 align:middle line:90%
是很巧
Yes, it does.

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:06.078 align:middle line:90%
但你仍声称早在案发之前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.099 align:middle line:90%
就已丢弃了枪
before the murders took place.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.043 align:middle line:90%
这种说法倒是很省事
That's very convenient.

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:13.047 align:middle line:90%
这是实话
It's the truth.

00:04:13.047 --> 00:04:18.020 align:middle line:90%
警方打捞三天都没找到
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.001 align:middle line:90%
这样就无法比对
so no comparison could be made

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.061 align:middle line:90%
你的手枪和
between your gun and the bullets...

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:26.065 align:middle line:90%
受害者尸体上的弹痕
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.051 align:middle line:90%
所以呢
And that also...

00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:34.029 align:middle line:90%
这样也非常省事  不是吗  杜弗伦先生?
is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.056 align:middle line:90%
我是清白的
Since I am innocent of this crime...

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:59.008 align:middle line:90%
所以找不到枪反倒对我非常不利
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:02.065 align:middle line:90%
一切证据都向各位报告了
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:06.069 align:middle line:90%
脚印和胎痕证明被告在场
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.076 align:middle line:90%
散落地面的子弹上有他的指纹
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:12.092 align:middle line:90%
酒瓶碎片上同样也有指痕
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:14.069 align:middle line:90%
最重要的是...
And most of all...

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.096 align:middle line:90%
一位美女与情夫...
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:21.017 align:middle line:90%
相拥而死
lying dead in each other's arms.

00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:90%
他们是有伤风化
They had sinned.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.081 align:middle line:90%
但是...
But was their crime so great...

00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:30.021 align:middle line:90%
罪该致死吗?
as to merit a death sentence?

00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:33.095 align:middle line:90%
请各位与此同时...
While you think about that...

00:05:33.095 --> 00:05:36.062 align:middle line:90%
再考虑一件事
think about this:

00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:90%
一只左轮手枪只能装六发子弹  而非八发
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.046 align:middle line:90%
所以他并非一时冲动
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.046 align:middle line:90%
冲动并不可宽恕  但可理解
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.069 align:middle line:90%
然而...
No.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.003 align:middle line:90%
这是复仇
This was revenge...

00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:54.067 align:middle line:90%
残忍而冷血的谋杀  想想看
of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
这两人各中四枪
Four bullets per victim.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.004 align:middle line:90%
共八枪  而非六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.

00:06:00.004 --> 00:06:03.088 align:middle line:90%
因此他是先射完一轮
That means that he fired the gun empty...

00:06:03.088 --> 00:06:09.071 align:middle line:90%
再装弹补上两枪
and then stopped to reload...

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:13.005 align:middle line:90%
然后再一人添一枪
so that he could shoot each of them again. An extra bullet per lover...

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:18.032 align:middle line:90%
射穿脑袋
right in the head.

00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:23.053 align:middle line:90%
你面目冷漠  全无悔意  杜弗伦先生
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:90%
看见你就令我齿冷
It chills my blood just to look at you.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.067 align:middle line:90%
根据缅因州赋予我的权力...
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:35.021 align:middle line:90%
我判处你两次终身监禁 按序执行
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...

00:06:35.021 --> 00:07:02.087 align:middle line:90%
每名受害者一次  退庭!
one for each of your victims. So be it!

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:08.057 align:middle line:90%
坐下
Sit.

00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:12.034 align:middle line:90%
根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满20年
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:15.095 align:middle line:90%
-是的  -你改过自新了吗?
-Yes, sir.  -You feel you've been rehabilitated?

00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:19.068 align:middle line:90%
是的  改造好了
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

00:07:19.068 --> 00:07:22.075 align:middle line:90%
我已得到深刻教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:29.043 align:middle line:90%
真的  我已洗心革面
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:90%
我不会再做危害社会的事了
I'm no longer a danger to society.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.057 align:middle line:90%
我向上帝发誓
That's God's honest truth.

00:07:39.057 --> 00:08:10.027 align:middle line:84%
驳回

00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:11.077 align:middle line:90%
瑞德
Hey, Red.

00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:13.027 align:middle line:90%
怎样?
How'd it go?

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:15.071 align:middle line:90%
还不是老样子
Same old shit, different day.

00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.078 align:middle line:90%
我了解
Yeah, I know how you feel.

00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:20.055 align:middle line:90%
我下周也准备要吃闭门羹
I'm up for rejection next week.

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:23.028 align:middle line:90%
我上周才假释被拒
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

00:08:23.028 --> 00:08:24.078 align:middle line:90%
很正常
It happens.

00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:26.042 align:middle line:90%
嗨，瑞德，借一包烟吧
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:29.092 align:middle line:90%
滚开  你欠我五包
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:32.006 align:middle line:90%
-四包  -五包
-Four!  -Five!

00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:35.069 align:middle line:90%
美国每个监狱里可能都会有我这样的人
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:90%
我能为你弄到各种东西
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:90%
香烟啦  大麻啦
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.064 align:middle line:90%
家有喜事想喝白兰地也行
bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:46.097 align:middle line:90%
几乎是任何合理的东西
Damn near anything within reason.

00:08:46.097 --> 00:08:53.065 align:middle line:90%
是的 先生  我就像百货公司
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.078 align:middle line:90%
所以1949年  安迪·杜弗伦...
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...

00:08:56.078 --> 00:09:00.055 align:middle line:90%
让我替他弄张丽塔·海华丝的电影海报
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

00:09:00.055 --> 00:09:22.087 align:middle line:90%
我立刻回答 没问题!
I told him, "No problem."

00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:27.051 align:middle line:90%
大家到大门口集合

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:90%
安迪在47年初入肖申克监狱

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
因为杀害老婆和情夫
in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.081 align:middle line:90%
他本来是缅因州一家大银行的副总裁
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

00:09:55.081 --> 00:10:02.095 align:middle line:90%
年轻有为 前程远大
Good work for a man so young.

00:10:02.095 --> 00:10:40.085 align:middle line:90%

跟这位长官走
You follow this officer.

00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:01.094 align:middle line:90%
我这辈子没看过这么多满脸晦气的窝囊废

烟  我赌两根
Smokes. Put me down for two.

00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:35.047 align:middle line:90%

I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.084 align:middle line:90%
弱不禁风的
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

00:12:07.084 --> 00:12:10.018 align:middle line:90%
这是他给我的最初印象
That was my first impression of the man.

00:12:10.018 --> 00:12:11.081 align:middle line:90%

What do you say?

00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:20.012 align:middle line:90%
-我赌十根烟  -有种
-10 cigarettes.  -That's a rich bet.

00:12:20.012 --> 00:12:22.039 align:middle line:90%
谁要和我赌?
Who's going to prove me wrong?

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:24.049 align:middle line:90%
赫伍?  渣哥?
Heywood? Jigger?

00:12:24.049 --> 00:12:25.099 align:middle line:90%

All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

给钱是不可能的
Not one born whose asshole...

00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:37.051 align:middle line:90%
他们没一个生来有屁眼
wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:40.062 align:middle line:90%
-预算太少了  -我了解

再过一年  全都找他帮忙
Year after that, he did them all...

00:56:34.034 --> 00:56:38.001 align:middle line:90%
包括典狱长的
including the warden's.

00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:41.068 align:middle line:90%
再过一年的狱际棒球赛
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...

00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:45.068 align:middle line:90%
改在与税季重叠

Right. The holster too.

00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:58.096 align:middle line:90%
这笔钱可扣除
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

00:56:58.096 --> 00:57:02.070 align:middle line:90%
没错  安迪就像家庭工业
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:07.047 align:middle line:90%

好好的  突然亮刀子
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:41.057 align:middle line:90%
布鲁克  有话好说
We can talk about this, right?

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:45.057 align:middle line:90%
放屁  没啥可说  我要割断他喉咙

01:32:20.081 --> 01:32:24.002 align:middle line:90%
什么?
Sir?

01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:28.022 align:middle line:90%
显然汤米对你颇有好感

知道你痛苦  自然想让你高兴

01:32:32.036 --> 01:32:35.006 align:middle line:90%
他还小  脑筋不太灵光
He's young, not terribly bright.

01:32:35.006 --> 01:32:38.090 align:middle line:90%
根本不明会害苦了你
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:41.023 align:middle line:90%
他说的是实情
Sir, he's telling the truth.

01:32:41.023 --> 01:32:45.067 align:middle line:90%
就算真有厄摩这人
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

01:32:45.067 --> 01:32:50.051 align:middle line:90%
难道他会跪地哭诉  "是我杀的  我忏悔"
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

01:32:50.051 --> 01:32:53.041 align:middle line:90%
"顺便再给我加个无期徒刑吧"
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

这无所谓 只要有汤米的证词 我就可以要求重审
With Tommy's testimony,I can get a new trial.

01:32:56.042 --> 01:32:59.012 align:middle line:90%
但你得找到厄摩
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

01:32:59.012 --> 01:33:01.025 align:middle line:90%
他可能早就出狱了
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

01:33:01.025 --> 01:33:08.019 align:middle line:90%
但能查到住址和亲友  这是机会呀
They'd have his last known address.It's a chance, isn't it?

01:33:08.019 --> 01:33:10.086 align:middle line:90%
你真是个阿呆
How can you be so obtuse?

01:33:10.086 --> 01:33:13.037 align:middle line:90%
什么?
What?

01:33:13.037 --> 01:33:15.004 align:middle line:90%
你说我什么?
What did you call me?

01:33:15.004 --> 01:33:17.014 align:middle line:90%
你笨蛋  我说错了吗?
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

01:33:17.014 --> 01:33:18.097 align:middle line:90%

别给我添麻烦  面谈结束
Don't make it mine.This meeting is over.

01:33:30.078 --> 01:33:34.002 align:middle line:90%
我若出狱  绝不提你的事
If I got out, I'd never mentionwhat happens here.

01:33:34.002 --> 01:33:38.002 align:middle line:90%
我洗钱  与你同罪
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

01:33:38.002 --> 01:33:42.000 align:middle line:90%
不许你说钱这个字  兔崽子
Don't ever mention money to me,you son of a bitch!

Not in this office...

01:33:43.086 --> 01:33:46.003 align:middle line:90%

01:33:54.064 --> 01:33:58.041 align:middle line:90%
这是我重获自由的机会  你不懂吗?这是我的人生
This is my chance to get out!It's my life! Understand?!

01:33:58.041 --> 01:34:02.025 align:middle line:90%
带出去
Get him out!

01:34:02.025 --> 01:34:04.042 align:middle line:90%

01:34:07.032 --> 01:34:08.082 align:middle line:90%
都是我不对
It's all my fault.

01:34:08.082 --> 01:34:11.009 align:middle line:90%
胡说八道
Bullshit.

01:34:11.009 --> 01:34:13.099 align:middle line:90%
你没杀人  也没判安迪的罪
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

01:34:13.099 --> 01:34:16.060 align:middle line:90%
你是说安迪没罪?
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.083 align:middle line:90%
他真的无辜?
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:20.060 align:middle line:90%
看来是这样
It looks that way.

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:22.077 align:middle line:90%
我的天呀

亲爱的典狱长  你说的对  得救之道  就在其中

02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:48.011 align:middle line:90%
你是海利吗?  你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

02:02:48.011 --> 02:02:52.098 align:middle line:90%
从现在起 你所说的一切 都将可能成为法庭上对你不利的证词
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:57.065 align:middle line:90%
当时我没有在场  后来听说...
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

02:02:57.065 --> 02:03:05.002 align:middle line:90%
海利利被人带走的时候竟然哭得像个老娘们
when they took him away.

02:03:05.002 --> 02:03:24.038 align:middle line:90%
诺顿却无意乖乖就范
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

02:03:25.091 --> 02:03:31.078 align:middle line:90%

把门打开
Open the door.

02:03:34.072 --> 02:03:45.066 align:middle line:90%
我不清楚哪一把
I'm not sure which key.

02:03:45.066 --> 02:03:59.058 align:middle line:90%
诺顿 拒捕是罪上加罪
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

02:03:59.058 --> 02:04:03.025 align:middle line:90%
我猜他脑中最后一件事...
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...

02:04:03.025 --> 02:04:05.005 align:middle line:90%
除了枪子儿...
other than that bullet...

02:04:05.005 --> 02:04:11.099 align:middle line:90%
就是在想安迪为何能整倒他
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

02:04:11.099 --> 02:04:15.073 align:middle line:90%
典狱长见阎王之后不久
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...

02:04:15.073 --> 02:04:19.026 align:middle line:90%
我收到一张明信片
I got a postcard in the mail.

02:04:19.026 --> 02:04:22.030 align:middle line:90%
没写字  但有邮戳
It was blank,but the postmark said...

02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:24.097 align:middle line:90%
来自德州汉考克堡
Fort Hancock, Texas.

02:04:24.097 --> 02:04:26.060 align:middle line:90%
汉考克堡
Fort Hancock...

02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:28.074 align:middle line:90%
就在边境线上
right on the border.

02:04:28.074 --> 02:04:31.031 align:middle line:90%
是安迪出境的地方
That's where Andy crossed.

02:04:31.031 --> 02:04:35.078 align:middle line:90%
一想到 他开着敞篷车 疾驶而去的神情
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...

02:04:35.078 --> 02:04:39.085 align:middle line:90%
我就忍不住发笑
it always makes me laugh.

02:04:39.085 --> 02:04:41.079 align:middle line:90%
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

02:04:41.079 --> 02:04:44.002 align:middle line:90%
终于从臭气熏天的下水道里
who crawled through a river of shit...

02:04:44.002 --> 02:04:47.026 align:middle line:90%
清清白白的走了出来
and came out clean on the other side.

02:04:47.026 --> 02:04:49.043 align:middle line:90%
安迪·杜弗伦
Andy Dufresne...

02:04:49.043 --> 02:04:54.000 align:middle line:90%
向太平洋驶去
headed for the Pacific.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.037 align:middle line:90%
海利掐住他说...
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

02:04:56.037 --> 02:05:00.037 align:middle line:90%
"他活的不耐烦了"
He says, "I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

02:05:00.037 --> 02:05:03.091 align:middle line:90%
老友们常聊起他
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

02:05:03.091 --> 02:05:05.081 align:middle line:90%
他那些惊人之举
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

02:05:05.081 --> 02:05:09.011 align:middle line:90%
"请我朋友喝啤酒吧"
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

02:05:09.011 --> 02:05:12.002 align:middle line:90%
真的做到了
And he got it!

02:05:12.002 --> 02:05:14.069 align:middle line:90%
他走了  有时...
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:16.082 align:middle line:90%
令我感伤
Andy being gone.

02:05:16.082 --> 02:05:21.043 align:middle line:90%
有些鸟儿是不应该被关在笼子里的
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

02:05:21.043 --> 02:05:25.020 align:middle line:90%
因为它们的羽毛太丰润了
Their feathers are just too bright.

02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:27.037 align:middle line:90%
当他们飞走...
And when they fly away...

02:05:27.037 --> 02:05:32.084 align:middle line:90%
你会由衷地庆贺他获得自由
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

02:05:32.084 --> 02:05:34.057 align:middle line:90%
无奈的是...
But still...

02:05:34.057 --> 02:05:43.011 align:middle line:90%
你得继续在这乏味之地苟活
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

02:05:43.011 --> 02:06:09.094 align:middle line:90%
我真怀念这位友伴

根据你的材料 你的终身监禁已经服满40年
your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

02:06:23.012 --> 02:06:27.013 align:middle line:90%
你改过自新了吗?
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

02:06:27.013 --> 02:06:30.073 align:middle line:90%
改过自新?
Rehabilitated?

02:06:30.073 --> 02:06:33.063 align:middle line:90%
噢 让我想想
Well, now, let me see.

02:06:33.063 --> 02:06:38.007 align:middle line:90%
我不大明白这个词的含义
I don't have any idea what that means.

02:06:38.007 --> 02:06:40.091 align:middle line:90%
就是说准备好重返社会
It means you're ready to rejoin society...

02:06:40.091 --> 02:06:45.041 align:middle line:90%
我当然明白你的意思 年轻人
I know what you think it means, sonny.

02:06:45.041 --> 02:06:48.075 align:middle line:90%
对我而言 这只是个术语
To me it's just a made-up word.

02:06:48.075 --> 02:06:51.052 align:middle line:90%
就像政治家那些术语
A politician's word so that...

02:06:51.052 --> 02:06:55.052 align:middle line:90%
使你们穿西装打领带的...
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

02:06:55.052 --> 02:06:59.009 align:middle line:90%
有活干
and have a job.

02:06:59.009 --> 02:07:01.096 align:middle line:90%
你到底想了解什么?
What do you really want to know?

02:07:01.096 --> 02:07:04.036 align:middle line:90%
我后悔犯罪吗?
Am I sorry for what I did?

02:07:04.036 --> 02:07:07.043 align:middle line:90%
你后悔吗?
Well, are you?

02:07:07.043 --> 02:07:11.064 align:middle line:90%
我没有一天不后悔
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

02:07:11.064 --> 02:07:18.058 align:middle line:90%
但并非受惩罚才后悔
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

02:07:18.058 --> 02:07:23.028 align:middle line:90%
我回首前尘往事
I look back on the way I was then...

02:07:23.028 --> 02:07:25.055 align:middle line:90%
那个
a young...

02:07:25.055 --> 02:07:32.006 align:middle line:90%
犯下重罪的小笨蛋
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

02:07:32.006 --> 02:07:35.069 align:middle line:90%
我想跟他沟通
I want to talk to him.

02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:38.090 align:middle line:90%
我试图讲道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

02:07:38.090 --> 02:07:42.093 align:middle line:90%
让他明了
Tell him the way things are.

02:07:42.093 --> 02:07:46.057 align:middle line:90%
但我办不到
But I can't.

02:07:46.057 --> 02:07:49.077 align:middle line:90%
那个少年早就不见了
That kid's long gone...

02:07:49.077 --> 02:07:53.095 align:middle line:90%
只剩下我垂老之躯
and this old man is all that's left.

02:07:53.095 --> 02:07:56.078 align:middle line:90%
我得接受事实
I got to live with that.

02:07:56.078 --> 02:07:58.085 align:middle line:90%
改过自新?
Rehabilitated?

02:07:58.085 --> 02:08:01.062 align:middle line:90%
狗屁不通的词
It's just a bullshit word.

02:08:01.062 --> 02:08:07.063 align:middle line:90%
你盖章吧  别浪费我的时间
So you go on and stamp your forms,sonny, and stop wasting my time.

02:08:07.063 --> 02:08:10.023 align:middle line:90%
告诉你一句实话
Because to tell you the truth...

02:08:10.023 --> 02:08:25.044 align:middle line:90%
我他妈的不在乎
I don't give a shit.

02:08:25.044 --> 02:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%

谢谢你
Here you go, miss.

02:09:43.009 --> 02:09:49.093 align:middle line:90%
可以上厕所吗?
Restroom break?

02:09:49.093 --> 02:09:55.050 align:middle line:90%
别要尿尿就来报告  要去就去  懂吗?
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

02:09:55.050 --> 02:10:07.051 align:middle line:90%
是的
yes

02:10:07.051 --> 02:10:11.042 align:middle line:90%
我报告了40年

02:10:11.042 --> 02:10:17.092 align:middle line:90%
没报告  一滴也挤不出
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

02:10:17.092 --> 02:10:21.076 align:middle line:90%
我得面对残酷的事实
There's a harsh truth to face.

02:10:21.076 --> 02:10:32.054 align:middle line:90%
我根本混不下去
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

02:10:32.054 --> 02:10:37.004 align:middle line:90%
我一心想违犯假释
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...

02:10:37.004 --> 02:10:44.072 align:middle line:90%
也许能重返肖申克
so maybe they'd send me back.

02:10:44.072 --> 02:10:48.005 align:middle line:90%
活在恐惧中真是糟糕
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

02:10:48.005 --> 02:10:49.092 align:middle line:90%
布鲁克体会过
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

02:10:49.092 --> 02:10:53.046 align:middle line:90%
